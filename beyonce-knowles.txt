All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up
Oh baby, how you doing?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase
Some women were made but me, myself
I like to think that I was created for a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you? You feel me
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a site to see, kind of something like me
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he love my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano
playin' everything so easy,
it's like you seem so sure.
still your ways, you dont see
i'm not sure if they're for me.
then things come right along our way, though we didn't truly ask.
it seems as if they're gonna linger
with every delight they bring,
just like what you have truly seemed.
i'm trying to think of what you really want to say,
even through my darkest day.
you might want to leave me,
feeling strange about you
like you're gonna let me know,
when words then slipped out of you.
when words dont come so easy to say
you just leave me feeling, come what may
though i want things coming from your way.
i say to you, you bore me all the time
when you seem to hold back all in you,
all that you want to let me know.
why dont you have the courage?
speak up and i'll listen,
if you truly want me to know, then tell me.
is there something wrong with you
and you seem fastened there.
it sounds as if there'll be a melody
if things in you are let out
and then i will feel alright.
when you sleep, do you feel the same,
exactly as i do?
i really want to hear things from you,
though i've felt something new
eversince you acted that way.
if i go,
would you still mind telling me?
if i stay,
you seem to let the days go by.
if you truly want to let me know,
then tell me.
If you search
For tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love
You need to live
But if you look
For truthfulness
You might just
As well be blind
It always seems to be
So hard to give
Chorus:
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly
What I need from you
I can always
Find someone
To say
They sympathize
If I wear my heart
Out on my sleeve
But I don't want
Some pretty face
To tell me
Pretty lies
All I want
Is someone
To believe
(Chorus)
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again
I know, I know
When I'm deep
Inside of me
Don't be
Too concerned
I won't ask
For nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want
Sincerity
Tell me where else
Can I turn
When
You're the one
That I depend upon
(Chorus)
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
[Verse 1:]
If I wrote a book about where we stand
Then the title of my book would be "Life with Superman"
That's how you make me feel I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same I see it everyday
In all the things you do
In all the things you say
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I
[Verse 2:]
If I were to try to count the ways
You make me smile
I'd run out of fingers
Before I run out of timeless things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my lovin strong
Make me wanna try my best
To give you what you want and what you need
Give you my whole heart, not just a little piece
More than a minimum,
I'm talking everything
More than a single wish,
I'm talking every dream
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I wanna rock with you
[Bridge:]
If there's options I don't want them
They're not worth my time
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you I like us just fine
You're a rock in the sand
You're a smile in a cry
You're my joy through the pain
You're the truth through the lies
No matter what I do I know that I can count on you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I wanna rock with you

I heard
Church bells ringing
I heard
A choir singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring
Oooh, oh
I saw them
Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man
I heard
Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending
Ooh
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
This is just another day that I would spend
Waitin' for the right one.
Staring at the night and wishin' I could be the one
To feel the warm sun.
You're a dream, but I'm wide awake
I'm in Heaven, for heaven sakes
So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready)
I could never need you more than now
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
Hold on to me tight
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
Tell me that your living in a place
Where no one else can find you.
Tell me that your sanging out my name,
Hoping that I'll hear you.
Tell me "No" and I'll fade away,
But this is lovin that I won't waste
So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready)
I could never need you more than now
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
hold on to me tight
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
What are the words, I'm needin' to hear
How do I know if I'll ever love again
Seeing your face makes everything clear (clear) clear
And I will never be the same
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
hold on to me tight
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting ooh
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
It's 6 o'clock
and seconds feel like hours as I sit here
and watch them tick away
And just the thought
of seeing you again I wanna sing
I've been longing for this day
I'll be waiting
'cause I cant smile untill I see your smile
I'll be waiting
there's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'cause patiently I'll wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I'll wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait
It's 12 am
the crowd is getting thin but it's okay
'cause I ain't here for them
No no no
And I refuse
to move from where I am
until I feel your heart
pressed against mine again
I'm waiting!
I'll be waiting
'cause I cant smile until I see your smile
I'll be waiting
there's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'cause patiently I'll wait right here for you
I don't care how long it takes
I don't mind I'm alright I'll sit and wait
'til the sun comes down and rise
and come right back up again
You're the best thing that's happened in my life
When your aps in the bar is in my life
and it just aint right
So take as long as you like
I'm waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting (4x)
I'm waiting
I'll be waiting
I cant smile until I see your smile
I'll be waiting
There's nothing else that I would rather do
I'll be waiting
'cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'cause patiently I'll wait right here for you
I'll be waiting
I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting

I'll be waiting
'cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart
I'll be waiting
'cause patiently I wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait right here for you
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Patiently I wait
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
[Verse 1:]
I read all of the magazines
while waiting around
you said you couldn't wait to see me
but you got stuck in town
so turn off the phone
now we're finally alone
and some moments at the end of the day
feel your touch and it's the sweetest
your kisses are my weakness
i never want them to go away
Chorus:
i wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
as i look into your eyes (eyes)
no need to get busy so lets take our time
and make slow love slow love
and every minute that we have (have)
it goes too fast
wanna show you how to rock it
so this feelin last and
make slow love slow love
slow love slow love slow love all night
Verse 2:
it is just a few little things
that you gotta know
a girl will give you all of her heart
when it's happening slow
i need a little laughter
and love will follow after
lets take this chance to steal away
your kisses are delicious
and no one is gonna miss us
tonight i really want you to stay
Chorus:
i wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
as i look into your eyes (eyes)
no need to get busy so lets take our time
and make slow love slow love
and every minute that we have (have)
it goes too fast
wanna show you how to rock it
so this feelin last and
make slow love slow love
slow love slow love slow love all night
Bridge:
so I'm callin out do you hear my cries?
don't have to say goodbye
your the breath on my skin cherish the taste
it's far too good to go to waste
feel my desire
make sweet love all through
all through the night
make love through the night
Chorus:
i wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
as i look into your eyes (eyes)
no need to get busy so lets take our time
and make slow love slow love
and every minute that we have (have)
it goes too fast
wanna show you how to rock it
so this feelin last and
make slow love slow love
slow love all night
Chorus:
i wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
as i look into your eyes (eyes)
no need to get busy so lets take our time
and make slow love slow love
and every minute that we have (have)
it goes too fast
wanna show you how to rock it
so this feelin last and
make slow love slow love
slow love slow love slow love all night
N-n-now, honey
You better sit down and look around
'Cause you must've bumped yo' head
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home
Me, the kids, and the dog is gone
Check my credentials
I give you everything you want, everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
I got beauty, I got class
I got style and I got ass
And you don't even care to care, looka here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
N-n-n-n-n-no
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune, ooh
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me
I'm lovely, there's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain dumb
I lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
Well, who's gonna be mine?
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?
After she saves the world
I bottle all my hurt inside
I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
With eyes lead to a pot of gold
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?
After she saves the world
I've given too much of myself
And now it's driving me crazy
(I'm crying out for help)
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here
And save me, save me from myself
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?
After she saves the world
Hello hello baby you called

You're breakin' up on me
Sorry I cannot hear you

Sorry I cannot hear you I'm kinda busy
Just a second

You shoulda made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kinda busy
Stop callin'

Call all but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Cuz I'm out in the club

And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Boy the way you blown up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster
Leave my girls no faster
I shoulda left my phone at home
'Cuz this is a disaster
Calling like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer
Not that I don't like you
I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
'Cuz I'll be dancin'
Cuz I'll be dancin'
Cuz I'll be dancin'
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
Cuz I'll be dancin'
Stop callin
Stop callin
I don't wanna think anymore

Cuz I'm out in the club
And I'm sippin that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Feels like I'm losing my mind
Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe, you belong to me
oohh ooohh
I'm going trough difficult times
I always thought you were mine
Love doesn't feel like this, this is my final wish
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back ya hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go, let me do B
(2x) You've got me chasing after you like a ice cream truck, I try my luck and catch up, but it's always out of luck
Faster and faster I ran
You sped up and then
Just as I thought I've caught up
I'm chasing you again
Finally,
You stopped and I jumped on
I realized your flavor was wrong
You thought I was still holding on
It's good to know your gone
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your love's no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back ya hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go, Let me do B
(2x) You've got me chasing after you like a ice cream truck, I try my luck and catch up, but it's always out of luck.
Youre everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you couldve been
But still you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
Youre the only one I wish I could forget
The only one Id love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, youre the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
Cause I cant erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know Ill be there at the end of the day
I dont wanna be without you babe
I dont want a broken heart
Dont wanna take a breath with out you babe
I dont wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I dont want to love you in no kind of way no no
I dont want a broken heart
And I dont wanna play the broken-hearted girlNo...No
No broken-hearted girl
Im no broken-hearted girl
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now Ive always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I want to put this out
You say youve got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel youre not deserving me
And still youre in my heart
But youre the only one and yes
There are times when I hate you
But I dont complain
Cause Ive been afraid that you would've walk away
Oh but now I dont hate you
Im happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day
I dont wanna be without you babe
I dont want a broken heart
Dont wanna take breath with out you babe
I dont wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I dont want to love you in no kind of way no no
I dont want a broken heart
And I dont wanna play the broken-hearted girl...NoNo
No broken-hearted girl
Now Im at a place I thought Id never beOooo
Im living in a world thats all about you and meyeah
Ain't gotta be afraid my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away With you
yeah yeah yeah, ohh ohh ohh
I dont wanna be without my baby
I dont wanna a broken heart
Dont want to take a breath with out my baby
I dont wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I dont want to love you in no kind of way..No..No
I dont want a broken heart
I dont wanna play the broken-hearted girl..No..No..
No broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl Nono
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
I gotta give up
to quite the storm that rages inside
the way that I hit my damage part
you gave me away
And I've had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
I'm finding strange to follow it trough
I'm ready to change
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, so let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control (x8)
I'm opening it up
show me a sign I can't relieve
It's crazy emotions flow trough me
I'm gonna explode
You take me away
and what is my ordinary life
I wont be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control
Nothing injured nothing gained
New horizon ready to play
with every breath you take it away
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control (x8)
It really hurts to say this yes it does
But after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
You and me
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
Won't you just assume he doesn't care
To internalize it all isn't fare
So I address the problem so that he's aware
But I still feel all alone even when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand
That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
You're bad for me I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss you're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart breaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control
[Chorus]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do it's a catch 22
cause the cure is found in you I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
[Verse 2]
You aint right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait I'm alive
But how long will it last
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down
[Chorus]
Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
I'm not sure what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
[Bridge]
It's just not my body (No)
It's my mind, you don't know
How many times I told myself
This cant do (cant do)
And that I don't need you (No I don't need you)(no)
It's so unfair(fair) that I find myself right back in your care(care)
And what's good is that when you're not always there (there there)
You're no good for my health (my heath)
You're just like poison (whoa whoa whoa) (repeat)
[Chorus]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I cant lie
Baby Kiss me one more time
you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
I'm not sure what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it to
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time
Before I die
(na na na na)

Beyonc - Intro:
Beyonce
IAM
Welcome
Welcome
Hey
Ohhhh
Beyonc - Chorus:
Welcome to a place
Where people lie to your face
Just to get it done.
Welcome to the human race
Where if you ain't got money, then you'll pay in pain
Welcome to this world of ours
And if you had the chance would you come back again ?
Cause now you're here there ain't no turning back,
You got tears in your eyes
And the monkey on your back (?)*
Akhenaton - Verse 1:
Bienvenue l o l'fort tue le faible, o la faim tue de fait
O la socit t'congratule, et t'accepte une fois la fortune faite,
O les dettes cumulent, o l'crdit accule, des tas d'foyers,
O les hommes en perte d'idaux, jurent qu'par les putes dvoyes en vido,
Chaque soir c'est la fte, les salons cossus attirent les fesses,
Sur les gros cads, qui arrosent les guridons de pure cocane,
Ici, les gosses rvent d't'Pirs, beaucoup partent et peu qui restent,
Nombreux sont ceux qui ds 13 ans connaissent leur premire ivresse,
Bienvenue l o l'air pollu, par les pots d'chappement dclenchent
Allergies en cascade, et taux record d'O3 dans les bronches,
Douleurs dans les hanches, rien plus d'dangereux qu'la faune humaine
Quand ils explosent un fourgon Brinks sans peine au Tri-Nitro-Tolune,
Les vices connus gnent la machine de l'Etat, les cabinets changent
Laissent la merde en tat, peu passent les menottes en mtal, on en est l
Ici 300 blinds font c'qui veulent, font comme s'ils vivent seuls
Ramnent tout leur p'tite gueule, quand mille meurent fauchs dans l'viseur
Bienvenue, aprs le 11 septembre on voque une aut'voie
Au silence : dis au revoir, l'enculeur d'aut'fois, dit baiser le monde haute voix
O les vieux des pays riches fantasment sur les m'mes de Bangkok
Pourquoi donc mettre part ces connards en taule
Ici on croit moins en Dieu qu'aux fant'mes, un hymne sanguinaire
On entonne, partout on sent la peur d'un peuple pass au pantone
L'hiver mange l't, et l'printemps parfois tue l'automne,
Crie Plus fort, les grands de c'monde, ont gar quelque part leur sonotone
Bienvenue, mes p'tits anges
Car voici c'monde
Beyonc - Chorus:
Welcome to a place

We all have a purpose in this world
We have to believe that we belong
Can't forget where we came from
We came from love.
Shurik'n - Verse 2:
Bienvenue dans c'truc entre enfer et paradis tant't l'un tant't l'autre.
Ange et dmon s'y disputent le parvis pour enjeu ceux qui s'y vautrent.
O l'on s'occupe de l'horreur seulement quand elle frappe nos portes.
O la rumeur tue sournoisement, vicieux coup de surin dans l'aorte.
O tu bouffes de la merde chaque jour et on te le dit qu'20 ans aprs.
Parce qu'en fait ils s'en tapent de c' qu'on pense on l'sait mais ils le diront jamais.
O on est trop con pour voir qu'un mec est bon bien avant qu'il meure
Puis on se vante de le connatre achetant ses tableaux visitant sa demeure
Bienvenue dans c'monde o on se dit tous gaux blague part l
L'caniveau l haut c'est les bureaux mais le mieux c'est au milieu
O on se sait si fragile qu'on prvoit les pices d'rechange
D'ici peu de temps on s'achtera des jambes en famille le dimanche
O tout le monde ne mange pas sa faim lieu de conflit sans fin
Crer dans le fond pour qu'un seul parvienne ses fins
La misre comme moyen o le suppos mort esclavage svit encore en divers lieux
Tu vois ! Il y a toujours des grains de poussire vaniteux qui s'prennent pour des dieux
Bienvenue pas Gattaca mais presque o seul l'lu vite la presse
On parque le reste en attendant que vieillesse se manifeste,
O on parle prslection, d'amlioration, transformation
Gntique, c'est pas magnifique une armada de super soldats de plomb
O on s'tue pour un bifteck ou un bifton
O on entend le mensonge aveugle, on voit pas l'illusion, envole la laine du mouton
Je t'annonce le sombre, parce que le clair, j'prfrerais qu'tu le dcouvre,
Allez petit ! Lance toi t'inquite fonce ! Moi, j'te couvre
Beyonc - Chorus:

Took me a while but I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out to be picked on
Talked about, out my friends mouths
I've been beat down til He turned my life around
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I used to wake up somedays
And wish I'd stayed asleep
Cause I went to bed on top of the world
Today the world's on top of me
Now everybody's got opinions
They ain't been in my position
That it breaks my heart
When I hear what they have to say about me
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
And I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned by the world
If I don't succeed
Cause I aint good enough
But He still loves me
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed to be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cause through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without pain?
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still love me
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned by the world
If I dont succeed
Cause I aint good enough
But He still loves me
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned be the word
If I don't succeed
Cause I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I aint good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
(But the Lord still loves me)

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my mine name that is on that tag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
And call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I am such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I'll have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So since Im not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you, I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is replacing you is so easy
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute
You could pack all your things, we're finished
(You must not know 'bout me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
(You must not know 'bout me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
Remember the first day when I saw your face
remember the first day you smiled at me
you stepped to me and then you said to me
I was the women you dreamed about
remember the first day when you called my house
remember the first day when you took me out
we had butterflies
although we tried to hide it
and we both had a beautiful night
the way we held each others hands
the way we talked
the way we laughed
it felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one
ohhh
I know that he loves me cause he told me so
I know that he loves me cause his feelings show
when he stares at me
you see he cares for me
you see how he's so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
and he's missin me
if he's not kissin me
and when he looks at me
his brown eyes tell his soul
remember the first day, the first day we kissed
remember the first day we had an arguement
we apologized and then we compromised
and we haven't argued since
remember the first day we stopped playing games
remember the first day you fell in love with me
it felt so good for you to say those words
cause I felt the same way too
the way we held each others hands
the way we talked
the way we laughed
it felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one
ohhhh
I know that he loves me cause he told me so
I know that he loves me cause his feelings show
when he stares for me, you see he cares for me

I know that he loves me cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
and he's missin me
if he's not kissin me
and when you looks at me
his brown eyes tell his soul
and when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul
you say that he's wrong
you say that he's no good
leave em alone 'cause he's gonna hurt you
but what they don't know is how he makes me feel
you say that he creeps
always runnin' the streets
he's playing the game
and he'll never love me
you say that he's fake but why does it feel so real
Hook
no matter what you say i ain't goin no where
no matter what you think i will always be there
the love that we share it lives inside of me
no matter what you hear it's all in the past
no matter what you feelin this love is gone last
the heart of his soul it breeds inside of me
Chorus
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
My man, with him I'm so comfortable
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
He's thugged out but he's my man
Verse
you say you don't trust em
because he been locked up
you say that he trouble 'cause he out in the strip club
but you were young once so you should understand
you say that you know
so you been a witness
you say it's foshow
say he got a mistress
until you can show me i'm gone stand by him
Hook
no matter what you say i ain't goin no where
no matter what you think i gon always be there
the love that we share it lives inside of me
no matter what you hear it is all in the past
no matter what you feelin this love is gone last
the heart of his soul it breeds inside of me
Chorus
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
My man, with him I'm so comfortable
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
He's thugged out but he's my man
Chorus
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
My man, with him I'm so comfortable
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
He's thugged out but he's my man

Repeat Pre-chorus and Chorus
Bridge:
You know I'm feelin you tonight,
So let's find a certain spot to go
Where we can get to know each other better
I'll go and tell my girls
You go and tell your boys
Before we leavin' tell me whats it' gon' be (repeat 1x)
Chorus until fade
He is always laughin' and flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact you've been real distance lately
Actin' like I'm not even there
He says that you don't deserve a girl like me
I'm startin' to think that he's right
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
If this happen
Then it proves that your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
Why is that, when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I tried to chill with you, dance or whatever
And your homeboy is more interested than you
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tended to pay attention too
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
If this happen
Then it proves that your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
Boy, when I tried to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
You want some lovin' that's when it's cool
But, baby boy, I'm not a fool
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
(Wanted me)
If this happen, then it proves that your love was never true
(No, no, no, how could you let him take your woman)
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
(How you gonna let him take me from you)
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
No, no, you never wanted me
If this happen, then it proves that yourl ove was never true
(Just, let me go, let me go, just let me know)
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
You don't care about me at all
You treat me like dirt all the time
what do I have to do
oh baby your not my boo
Chorus:
cause you treat me like a girl with no name
I wonder if it'll be the same
why can't you call me Beyonce
or is it that your not happy
cause i'm a girl with no name
Why are we together and we don't talk to eachother
why do you call me baby
I told you my name is beyonce
so thats all I have to say
Chorus:

I wonder if you'll be the same

Por que a ti, si hay mil por ahi, el es un perro

A mi tambien siempre quiere verme sola
No hay que caer en su trampa una vez mas

I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle yes indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet you see the picture clear as day
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me, flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love
I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I need
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me, flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
Don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
Catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
You, you, you
Verse 1:
It's really been weighing on me
Tell me what did I do
To have ya'll hating on me
When I don't have nothing to prove
Sometimes I shake my head
When I'm laying down in my bed
Thinking 'bout the things been said
When you really don't know me yet
Pre-Chorus:
Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconceived
It's out my character for me to feed into ya,
give it a rest
You must admire me spend so much time on me
consuming yo head...
Chorus:
I can't take no more
(I think its time for me to let it all out)
I can't take no more
(Why my name always up in yo mouth)
What you hate me for
(I'm so tired of all of these lies)
I can't take no more (hey), no more (no more), no more
Verse 2:
It's really been weighing on me
I'm not myself lately
I feel a little incomplete
But I'm not gone lose no sleep
I keep it all in my mind
Cause it gotta get better in time
Why don't you live your life
And let me live mine
Pre-Chorus:
Gotta clear up some things,
There have been many things said about me (said about me)
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconceived (preconceived)
Its out of my character for me to feed into ya,
give it a rest(give it a rest)
You must admire me spend so much time on me
consuming yo head (and I cant take it no more)
Chorus:
I can't take no more
(I think its time for me to let it all out)
I can't take no more
(Why my name always up in yo mouth)
What you hate me for
(I'm so tired of all of these lies)
I can't take no more, (hey) , no more, (no more), no more
Break-down/Bridge:
You,You, You don't know...(repeat x4)
Chorus (x2):
I can't take no more
(I think its time for me to let it all out)
I can't take no more
(Why my name always up in yo mouth)
What you hate me for
(I'm so tired of all of these lies)
I can't take no more, (hey) , no more, (no more), no more
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Just leave me alone, leave me alone,
Just leave me alone, leave me alone,
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Uhh uhh uhh.
You ready 'b' Let's go get 'em..
Look for me! Young, be
Cruisin' down the westside... highway
Doing what we like to do... our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's true to the heart
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and be
[Chorus]
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend.
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend.
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin
Now they 'bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin that Hermes Burkin bag,
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!
[Chorus]
(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfried,
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you,
Even if that somebody is me
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
[Chorus]
Hey yo, B
This a good look right here, yeah
Bad Boy, baby, uh
Hey yo, B
I've been wanting to explain to you what it is that you do to me
Got me open, I am so in love with loving you
Touching places, no one else has ever made me feel incredible
When you touch me, I feel sexy, no one else like you
Got me going off all the love you give me
I'd be crazy to ever want to leave
I love the way your hands belong over there
Please don't say you're gonna stop loving me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, when you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, the way you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me
I lose all control when you are here and baby, it amazes me
How could someone be so sexy and love like you do
Oh baby, do you understand the power that you posses over me
Can't accept this feeling and I don't think I want to
Got me going off all the love you give me
I'd be crazy to ever want to leave
I love the way your hands belong over there
Please don't say you're gonna stop loving me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, when you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, the way you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me
It's crazy how much I'm in love with you
It's all 'cause you love me the way you do
Don't want no other love but you
'Cause no one else has ever made me feel this good
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, when you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, the way you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me
Making love to me
Making love to me
Making love to me
Making love to me
Making love to me, me, me
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
Its only beginning to find release
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice, you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago
Oh I'm screaming out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice, you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I am done believing you
You don't know not what I am feeling
I'm more than what you've made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I got to find my own, my own
It ain't for everybody
(Uhh)

Got so much control, you haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why, I think, I'm ready
Baby, I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time
And baby, I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead but it's my first time
And baby, I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time
And baby, I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead, remember it's my first time
Arm in arm eye to eye
As the music plays emotions rise, I think, I'm ready
In your eyes, I see three words
Hold me tight 'cause I'm about burst, I think, I'm ready
I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control, you haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why, I think, I'm ready
Baby I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time
Baby, I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead but it's my first time

I remember, when you used to take me
On a bike ride every day, on the bayou
(Remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
You come home from work and I jump in your arms when I saw you
(I was so excited)
I was so happy to see you, ooh
(So happy to see you)
Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become, yeah
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make, you're there for me
You cure my disappointments
And you heal my pain
You understood my biz and you protected me
I treasure every year in place a comemory
And that's why, I want my unborn son
To be like, my daddy
I want my husband to be like, my daddy
There is no one else like, my daddy
And I thank you for lovin' me
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you shoulda seen your face)
I still remember, I called you cryin'
'Cuz of my tattoo, coulda said, "Beyonce, I told ya so"
Instead you said you'd get one too
(You and my momma said ya'll get one just like mine)
Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do, ohh
You've given me tight security
No matter what mistakes I know, you're there for me
You killed my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood by biz and you protected me
I treasure every extraordinary memory, that's why
My unborn son to be like, my daddy
I want my husband to be like, my daddy
There is no one else like, my daddy
And I thank you for lovin' me
Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won't go away
I know I'm lucky, know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming, Lord why did you pick me?
Can't stop my tears from falling, I love you so much daddy
([Inaudible] to be like my daddy)
(Thank you, you've done so much for me, I love you, daddy)
([Inaudible] to be like my daddy)
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
(There is no one else like my daddy)
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
(I thank you)
There is no one else like my daddy
(There is no one else like my daddy)
No one else replace my daddy
This is for my fans

Square-cut or pear shaped,
These rocks don't lose their shape.
Diamonds are a girls best friend.
Diamonds are a girls best friend.
Diamonds! Diamonds!
I don't mean rhinestones!
Every step I make
And every breath I take
I took 'cause I can't wait
To be closer to you
Baby, you're so sweet
You give me cavities
I get a stomach ache
If I can't be with you
At night I fall asleep
And I don't want to wake up
'Cause you are in my dreams
A heavenly creation
In the body that
I only want to share with you
Hey
[Chorus]
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Baby, we will never finish
To be continued
Separation can't change
The love I feel for you
I'm gonna definitely be affectionate
Snuggle up tonight--let's get real intimate
'Cause only you can satisfy my appetite
'Cause when it comes to love
You get me get so excited
When I taste your lips
My body melts in bliss every time
[Chorus: x2]
You are my (you are my)
Universe (universe)
Everything I want and
Everything I need and
Everything worth waiting for
For better or for worse
Constant craving
Your love enslaves me, oh
[Chorus]
Give it to me, baby
I want to give it to you
Give it to me, baby
I can't wait
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
I can't wait
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you
(Chorus)

Gitana!
Ven y quÃ©date conmigo, dame el corazÃ³n
Vida mÃ­a estoy muriendo lento en mi prisiÃ³n
Anda, dime lo que sientes, quÃ­tate el pudor
Y deja de sufrir, escapa con mi amor
DespuÃ©s te llevarÃ© hasta donde quieras
Sin temor y sin fronteras
Hasta donde sale el sol
Contigo soy capaz de lo que sea
No me importa lo que venga
Porque ya sÃ© a donde voy
Soy tu gitano, tu peregrino
La Ãºnica llave de tu destino
El que te cuida mÃ¡s que a su vida
Soy tu ladrÃ³n!
Soy tu gitana, tu compaÃ±era
La que te sigue, la que te espera
Voy a quererte aunque me saquen el corazÃ³n
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Yo nacÃ­ para tus ojos, para nadie mÃ¡s
Siempre voy a estar en tu camino
Alma de mi alma, corazÃ³n de tempestad
Dime por donde ir
DespuÃ©s te llevarÃ© hasta donde quieras
Sin temor y sin fronteras
Hasta donde sale el sol
Contigo soy capaz de lo que sea
No me importa lo que venga
Porque ya sÃ© a donde voy
Soy tu gitano, tu peregrino
La Ãºnica llave de tu destino
El que te cuida mÃ¡s que a su vida
Soy tu ladrÃ³n!
Soy tu gitana, tu compaÃ±era
La que te sigue, la que te espera
Voy a quererte aunque me saquen el corazÃ³n
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Nuestro amor, nuestro amor, nuestro amor
Oye, lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo asÃ­
Oye (uhum)
Como llora mi canciÃ³n
Preciso tu atenciÃ³n, debes oÃ­r
Hoy no se quien soy
Ni se a donde voy
Encontrarme hoy es mi misiÃ³n
De tu prisiÃ³n
Por fin ya soy
Libre
Oye, esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar
A mi corazÃ³n
Hoy, buscarÃ© mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy mÃ¡s de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
Nunca quisiste
Que me fuera a volar
Callar mi identidad, que gran error
Hoy grito, no tengo mÃ¡s temor
Hoy tu alumna te dice adiÃ³s
De tu prisiÃ³n por fin ya soy
Libre
Oye, esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar
A mi corazÃ³n
Hoy, buscarÃ© mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy mÃ¡s de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
Yo soy tu gran creaciÃ³n
Por eso es que me voy
Dime adiÃ³s
Dime adiÃ³s
Oye, lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir
Viviendo asÃ­
Ya me voy
BuscarÃ© mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy mÃ¡s de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor hoy ya lo decidÃ­
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
Mi voz
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvid, te olvid, mmm
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvid
En el closet, en un rincn
Estn tus cosas, esto se acab
Te juro que no te aguanto ms
No te quiero ya ni como amante

Te puedes marchar y no vuelvas jams
Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya vers que nunca ms me vuelves a engaar

T creas que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
A olvidar tu amor
Ya me cur del dolor
Ya te saqu de mi corazn
Vete con ella, solos los dos
Pobre de ti, lrgate me das asco
T eras mi luz
Pero hay amores que matan de dao
Me cans de ti
Ya no soy aquella infeliz
Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya vers que nunca ms me vuelves a engaar
Ya lrgate
Qu sabes t de m?
No me hagas rer
T creas que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

Este cuento al fin se ha acabado
(No me hagas rer)
Me vers con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor
It's a tale of a guy named Zeke,
Who has come here from Battle Creek.
As he walks with his Pepsi can,
He is bumped by the strangest man.
He feels no wish as he sees it roll,
Down the street to an open hole.
The taste sensation he loves so well,
Now is gone, and he starts to yell.
His Pepsi fell, he shows his lust (the joy of life)
The joy of life he needs it anyhow (the joy of life, the joy of taste)
He makes the sound of a tender bear (the joy of Pepsi)
As the crowd around him starts to swell.
Sir, a Pepsi please (the joy of life)
And they pack a Pepsi onto Zeke,
The Pepsi's found, the people cheer (the taste of Pepsi)
For the joy of Pepsi now is here!
Ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba, the Joy of Pepsi.
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my mine name that is on that tag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
And call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I am such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I'll have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So since Im not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you, I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is replacing you is so easy
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute
You could pack all your things, we're finished
(You must not know 'bout me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
(You must not know 'bout me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
He is always laughin' and flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact you've been real distance lately
Actin' like I'm not even there
He says that you don't deserve a girl like me
I'm startin' to think that he's right
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
If this happen
Then it proves that your was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
Why is that, when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I tried to chill with you, dance or whatever
And your homeboy is more interested than you
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tended to pay attention too
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
If this happen
Then it proves that your was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
Boy, when I tried to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
You want some lovin' that's when it's cool
But, baby boy, I'm not a fool
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
(Wanted me)
If this happen, then it proves that your was never true
(No, no, no, how could you let him take your woman)
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
(How you gonna let him take me from you)
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
No, no, you never wanted me
If this happen, then it proves that your was never true
(Just, let me go, let me go, just let me know)
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
Remember the first day when I saw your face?
Remember the first day when you smiled at me?
You stepped to me, and then you said to me,
I was the woman you dreamed about.
Remember the first day when you called my house?
Remember the first day when you took me out?
We had butterflies although we tried to hide it,
And we both had a beautiful night.
The way we held each other's hand,
The way we talked, the way we laughed,
It felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one
ooh oh oooh
I know that he loves me, cause he told me so
I know that he loves me, cause his feelings show
When he stares at me, you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me, if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul
Remember the first day, the first day we kissed?
Remember the first day we had an arguement?
We apologized, and then we compromised
And we haven't argued since
Remember the first day we stopped playing games?
Remember the first day you fell in love with me?
It felt so good for you to say those words
Cause I felt the same way too
The way we held each other's hand,
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt soo good to fall in love
And I knew right then and there you were the one ooh oh ohhwoah
I know that he loves me, cause he told me so
I know that he loves me, cause his feelings show
When he stares at me you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love,
I know that he loves me cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me, if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul.
I'm so happy, so happy that you're in my life
And baby now that you're a part of me
You showed me,
Showed me the true meaning of love (the true meaning of love)
And I know he loves me
I know that he loves me, cause he told me so
I know that he loves me, cause his feelings show
When he stares at me you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me, if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul
He looks at me and his brown eyes...
Tell his soul
Why Me Lord, What have I ever done
To deserve even one Of the Pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, What did I ever do
That was worth loving you Or the Kindness you've shown.
Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus, My Soul's in your Hand.
Try me Lord, If you think there's a Way
I can try to repay All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself On my Way back to you.
Yes Lord, help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus, My Soul's in your Hand.
(Andre 3000)
I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bet
Oooh and you
You and your head high
And your tears dry
Get on without your guy
And I, I, I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all we been through
And you, and you, and you, you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black
(Hook- Andre 3000)
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
I go back to her and you go back to, you go back to
You go back to
(Beyonce)
I, I loved you much
It's not enough
I love blow and you love puff
And life, is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside
(Hook -Beyonce)
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to, I go back to black
[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oooh
Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
[Hook 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup....
[Verse 2: Beyonce]
On my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is, we should get married
We should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away
[Pre-Hook: BeyoncÃ©]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay
[Hook 2: Drake & BeyoncÃ©]
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to
[Hook 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl

One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup....
[Verse 3: Drake]
From 8 until late, I think 'bout you
You own my nights I don't know what to do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should
[Pre-Hook: Drake]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay
[Hook 2: Drake & BeyoncÃ©]

[Verse 4: Drake]
I gotta pull up on you
You gon make me have to pull up on you
Don't go ghost on me, I'mma go Thriller on you, I'mma just
I'mma let my hands do the talking when I see you baby girl
I miss feeling on you, I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you
I been about you and I'm still about you but
We ain't finished talking
I told you you don't need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking
Cuz they don't wanna see you happier than them and girl you swear they all
Your friends and there's been a problem
You the one they hate, just come with daddy
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back
And you tell me that you're done with that
And I believe it's true as long as you know who you belong to
[Outro: Beyonce]
All I'm really asking for is you
Long as you know who you belong to
[Verse 1]
When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different
From when I hear yours
Now thats just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror
After all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward
[Pre-Hook: Beyonce & Frank Ocean]
Super power
A subtle power
Super power
A tough love
Super power
Like a shark
Super power
Like a bear
[Hook: Beyonce & Frank Ocean]
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would move on
Without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down
[Verse 2]
And just like you I can't be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there
Tough love
Super power
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls
It's a super power
Super power
The laws of the world never stopped us once

Your challengers are a young group from Houston

On the ground
H, Town, Town, I'm coming down, coming down
[Verse 1 - Beyonce]
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches

Don't get it twisted, get it twisted

Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches (Crown)
Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches (Crown)

[Verse 2 - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls
"You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man"
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes
[Verse 3 - Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ride round in it, flawless
Flossin on that, flawless

Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister taught me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine
[Verse 4 - Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ride round in it, flawless
Flossin on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless

[Verse 2]
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we'll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping trying not to crash
[Pre-Hook]
Oh there daddy, daddy now you ripped my fur
Oh baby baby be sweating out my hair
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire l'activitÃ© physique, le coÃ¯t, tu aimes Ã§a?
Tu ne t'intÃ©resses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les fÃ©ministes dÃ©testent le sexe mais c'est une activitÃ© trÃ¨s stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cuz all the shit I hear is boring

We don't have forever

Before time is run out

Up in the club
We just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
You decided to dip
And now you wanna trip
Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him
He up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Cause cried my tears
For three good years
You can't be mad at me
Cause if you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it
If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad
Once you see that he want it
If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it
Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Once you see that he want it
If you liked it

I got gloss on my lips
A man on my hips
On me tighter than my Dereon jeans
Acting up
Drank in my cup
I could care less what you think
I need no permission
Did I mention?
Don't pay him any attention
Cause you had your turn
But now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss be
Cause if you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it

Your love is what I prefer
What I deserve
Here's a man
That makes me then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny
To infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm not the one you own
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost I'll be gone

Chunking deuces, chugging D'USSE
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say

I don't care if you on the run
Baby as long as I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out
The best in you
[Bridge: BeyoncÃ©]
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but
[Hook: BeyoncÃ©]
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing lose
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit
Matching tatts, this Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off
If things ring off
My nails get dirty
My past ain't pretty, my lady is, my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder then a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
You know its till the death, I hope it obvi to niggas
Cross the line, speak about mine

Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clat
Push your ma'fucka wig back, I did that

She was a good girl till she knew me
Now she is in the drop bussin' U'e
Screaming...
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
Deeper then words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death
Let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring me a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's you and me against the world, then so be it
[Verse 5: BeyoncÃ©]
I don't care if they give me life
I get all my life from you
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you
[Bridge]
[Verse 6: BeyoncÃ©]
I don't care I will never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear, no I swear
Without you I got nothing to lose
Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First go through my legs, go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah baby I'll beg, it comes
Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated

And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep end, your deep end, the deep

Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
Don't wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, over me
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls
I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass
Lemme put it in your face
By the way
If you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create
Rockets and waterfalls
[Hook]
Hard rock steady rock hard rock steady
Rock hard rock steady rock hard rock steady

You like it wet and so do I, You like it wet and so do I
I know you never waste a drip, I know you never waste a drip
I wonder how it feels sometimes
Must be good to you
[Pre-Hook]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing
[Hook]
Can you lick my skittles
That's the sweetest in the middle
Pink that's the flavor
Solve the riddle

Don't worry its nothing major
Make sure you clean that
That's the only way to get the
Flavor

I remember being young and so brave

Look at me Im a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
But now bitches I run this

They love the way I walk
'Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk
'Cause I aint pretending
It took a while, now I understand
Just where Im going
I know the world and I know who I am
'Bout time I show it
'Cause I put it (down like that, down like that)
And Im making (all these racks, all these racks)
And Im moving (round like that, round like that)
when I do it (I dont look back, dont look back).
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I can be bad if I want
I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want (whatever it is)
I'm a grown woman
So I know how to ride it
I'm a grown woman
And I'm so erotic
I'm a grown woman
Look down, got you so excited
I'm a grown woman
Look at my body
It ain't no fun
If a girl can't have none.
You really wanna know how I got it like that
'Cause I got a cute face
And my booty so fat
Go girl (go girl)
She got that bomb (that bomb)
That girl can get whatever she wants.

What about the bad guy goes good, yeah
And the missing missing love that's misunderstood, yeah
Black hour glass, our glass
Toast to clichÃ©s in a dark past
Toast to clichÃ©s in a dark past
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Boy meets girl, girl perfect women
Girl get the bustin' before the cops come running
Chunking deuces, chugging D'USSE
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say
[Verse 2: BeyoncÃ©]
I don't care if you on the run
Baby as long as I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out
The best in you
[Bridge: BeyoncÃ©]
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but
[Hook: BeyoncÃ©]
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing lose
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit
Matching tatts, this Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off
If things ring off
My nails get dirty
My past ain't pretty, my lady is, my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder then a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
You know its till the death, I hope it obvi to niggas
Cross the line, speak about mine
I'mma wave this tech, I'mma geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clat
Push your ma'fucka wig back, I did that
I been wilding since a juvi
She was a good girl till she knew me
Now she is in the drop bussin' U'e
Screaming...
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
Deeper then words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death
Let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring me a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's you and me against the world, then so be it
[Verse 5: BeyoncÃ©]
I don't care if they give me life
I get all my life from you
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you
[Bridge]
[Verse 6: BeyoncÃ©]
I don't care I will never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear, no I swear
Without you I got nothing to lose
My body is magnified
In the sun set me alight
My body, in your delights
Burn me up, set me alight
I can't deny, your desire
Feel like I'm on fire
When you touch me
I feel the flame licking at my feet
Can you feel the heat on my skin
Can you feel all my loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
Can you feel my heart burning
Can you feel all my good loving
You and me, we're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the sun
We're standing on the...
Let's get to hugging and kissing
Don't know the floor from the ceiling
When you get up in the kitchen nobody hotter than you
Know that I twerk it
And give you some of that worth it
Work it for daddy that's perfect
This Yonce only for you
Look at that ocean, can't you see it
Mixed up passions with fruit sangria
BB Cubana, ay que lindo
Ya tu sabes, camino como cocino, primo
There's only one thing on my mind
I want to love you long time
Want you to watch me while I whine
Want you to love me long time
We just having such a good time
Over and over we whine
With the flame lit and I can kiss you
While the sun kisses me
Can you feel the heat on my skin

[Verse 1]
Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me
When I look in your eyes, I feel alive
Some days we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you holding me tight, I feel alive
[Hook]
Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
Blue
[Verse 2]
Each day I feel so blessed to be looking at you
Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name
When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive
Now let's live it up
[Hook x2]
[Bridge]
We gotta hold on, I gotta hold on
You've got to hold on, you've got a hold on me
We gotta hold on, I gotta hold on
You've got to hold on, you've got a hold on me

[Hook]
I'm out that H-town
Coming, coming down
I'm coming down dripping candy on the ground
H, H-town, town, I'm coming down
Coming down dripping candy on the ground
[Verse 1]
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it , don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down bitches
[Bridge]
Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches
Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches
H-town vicious, h-h-town vicious
I'm so crown, bow bow down bitches
[Hook x2]
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gone take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
[Verse 2]
Rolling high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that's what good
Kiss my momma, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your boo was talking lip
I told my crew to smack that trick
Smack that trick, smack that trick
Guess what they did, smack that trick
Gold everything, gold ass chain
Gold ass rings, gold ass fangs
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights
I'm the number one chick, ain't need no hype
The capital b means, I'm 'bout that life
The capital b means, I'm 'bout that life
[Hook]
[Outro]
I remember my baby hair with my dookie braids
Frenchy's, Boudin in the parking lot
Shout out to Willie D
I was in that Willie D video when I was about fourteen, looking crazy
Shout out Pimp C
You know we used to sneak and listen to that UGK
Didn't do your girl but your sister was alright, damn
In ya homeboy's Caddy last night
Hold up, Texas trill
H-town going down, man
Miss Third Ward, your first question.
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, my aspiration in life, Waw that's a great question.
I wasn't expecting that question...
What is my aspiration in life?
Well, my aspiration in life...
Would be, to be happy.
(Uh huh huh)
(Uh huh huh)
(Uh huh huh)
[Verse 1:]
Mama said, "You're a pretty girl.
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters."
[Pre-Hook:]
Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down
[Hook:]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worse
Perfection is a disease of a nation
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worse
Tryin' fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery
(Uh huh huh)
[Verse 2:]
Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says, "Bigger is better."
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says, "Thinner is better."
Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down
[Hook:]
Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts (Pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts (Pretty hurts), shine the light on whatever's worse
Tryin' to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery
[Bridge:]
Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's my soul that needs surgery
It's my soul that needs surgery
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
And you break when the fake facades leave you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl
[Hook:]
Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse
(Pretty hurts)
Perfection is a disease of a nation
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse
Tryin' to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery
[Outro:]
When you're alone all by yourself
(Pretty hurts Pretty hurts)
And you're lying in your bed
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts)
Reflection stares right into you
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself?
(Pretty hurts Pretty hurts)
You stripped away the masquerade
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts)
The illusion has been shed
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself?
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself?
(Pretty hurts, Pretty hurts)
Yes
Uh huh huh
I fought for you
The hardest, it made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving
But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed
But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
But heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
So go on go home
[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with 50 of them girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up tell me how I'm looking babe
[Breakdown]
Boy this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking babe
Just tell me how it's looking babe
I do this all for you baby just take aim
Just tell me how it's looking babe
Just tell me how it's looking babe
How it's looking, how it's looking babe
[Verse 2]
Drop the bass mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off your tongue
'Cus when he wanna smash I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
YoncÃ© all on his mouth like liquor
YoncÃ© all on his mouth like liquor
YoncÃ© all on his mouth like liquor
YoncÃ© all on his mouth like liquor
Like like liquor, like like like liquor
YoncÃ© all on his mouth like liquor
YoncÃ© all on his mouth like liquor
YoncÃ© all on his mouth like liquor
YoncÃ© all on his mouth like liquor
Like like liquor, like like like liquor
[Verse 1]
I'm in my penthouse half naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous
[Hook]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
[Post-Hook]
Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this
[Verse 2]
Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
'yonce fillin' out this skirt
I look damn good I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy you been hanging out tonight
I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Been dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow
I ran into my ex
Said what up to his bestest
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas
Don't be jealous
[Hook]
[Post-Hook]
[Bridge]
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me
[Hook]
When you were born
The angels sighed in delight
They never thought
They'd see such a beautiful sight
You took the breath and the world was right again
Tears were shed how we have been blessed
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside
God made you beautiful
You're beautiful
[Intro: BeyoncÃ©]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking

I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
[Verse 1: BeyoncÃ©]

Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you
[Hook: BeyoncÃ©]

New sheets, he sweat it out, like wash rags, he wet it out
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic 'til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway, then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz serving all of this, swerv, surfing all of this good, good

To feel like he's a man
To feel the need for questioning

If you weren't by my side
You're my relation In connection to the sun
With you next to me There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrop I am the sea
With you and God,who's my sunlight I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud so proud to be your girl
You make the confusion Go all away
From this cold and messed up world
[Chorus]
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me
And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am Baby you
Were my man
I know it ain't easy Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny I see myself having
Your child I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful To have you by my side
[Chorus]
Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world To love, to hold, To
Feel, To breathe, To love you
Dangerously in love
[Chorus]
Dangerously,
Dangerous,
Dangerously in love with you
Oh I love you I love you I love you I love
You...
In this world
Of ordinary people
Exraordinary people
I'm so glad there is you
In this world
Of all the rated pleasures
Of undirated treasures
I'm so glad there is you
I live to love
I love to live with you beside me
This world so new
I'll walk you through with you to guide me
In this world
Where many people play at love
But hardly ever stay in
I'm so glad there is you
More than ever I'm glad there is you
More than ever I'm glad there is you
Feel like i'm loosing my mind
Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe you belong to me
oh oh
Im going through difficult times
I always thought you were mine
Love doesnt feel like this
This is my final wish
Hook:
The next time your truck rolls by

Faster and faster I ran

Its good to know whats goin on

it's about getting our freakdum drsses on
Remember those walls I built
Well baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I've got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
hatit I can see you halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over you face
haiti we can feel your halo
Pray it won't hide away
I can see your halo... halo...) halo
(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo-o
(I can feel your) halo... (halo...) halo-o-o
(I can see your) halo... (halo...) halo... uhoo
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest nights
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity came again
To pull me back to the ground again
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere we looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
haiti I can see you halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over you face

Listen,
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete
Listen, to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release
Oh,
The time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen....
[Chorus:]
Listen,
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known
Oh,
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own..
You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I'd thought had died
So long ago
Oh I'm screaming out, for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worked
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen...
[Chorus]
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't....
If you won't....
LISTEN!!!...
To the song here in my heart
A melody I've started
But I will complete
Oh,
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you've made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own..
My own...

baby you know i love you
baby you know i need you
you're all i ever wanted
you're the one for me, i know i can't deny it
that it was really met to be
I remember, when you used to take me
On a bike ride every day, on the bayou
(Remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
You come home from work and I jump in your arms when I saw you
(I was so excited)
I was so happy to see you, ooh
(So happy to see you)
Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become, yeah
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make, you're there for me
You cure my disappointments
And you heal my pain
You understood my biz and you protected me
I treasure every year in place a comemory
And that's why, I want my unborn son
To be like, my daddy
I want my husband to be like, my daddy
There is no one else like, my daddy
And I thank you for lovin' me
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
Daddy daddy, daddy daddy
I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you shoulda seen your face)
I still remember, I called you cryin'
'Cuz of my tattoo, coulda said, "Beyonce, I told ya so"
Instead you said you'd get one too
(You and my momma said ya'll get one just like mine)
Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do, ohh
You've given me tight security
No matter what mistakes I know, you're there for me
You killed my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood by biz and you protected me
I treasure every extraordinary memory, that's why
My unborn son to be like, my daddy
I want my husband to be like, my daddy
There is no one else like, my daddy
And I thank you for lovin' me
Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won't go away
I know I'm lucky, know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming, Lord why did you pick me?
Can't stop my tears from falling, I love you so much daddy
([Inaudible] to be like my daddy)
(Thank you, you've done so much for me, I love you, daddy)
([Inaudible] to be like my daddy)
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
(There is no one else like my daddy)
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
(I thank you)
There is no one else like my daddy
(There is no one else like my daddy)
No one else replace my daddy
[Chorus]
You've got me
You've got me
You've got me
You've got me speechless
Where you been, baby?
Waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key
That opens my place
My heart starts trembling
As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opens, doorknob turns
There appears your face
Going out' my head--I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles, making love all night
Feels so strange--it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms, lost for words--you've got me
[Chorus]
Laying so closely, I feel your skin rubbing and touching me
Only sweat between us, feeling you kissing and pleasing me
I rub your back, I kiss your neck--I know that you love when we touch like that
I can feel you need me--feels so good to me, feels so good to me
Going out' my head--I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles, making love all night
Feels so strange--it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms, lost for words--you've got me
[Chorus]
Yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes
Speechless
All I can say is
Yes, yes, yes
All I can say is
Yes, yes, yes
Kiss me
Hold me
You've got me
Speechless
The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh
And now I think about if it's my time to die
I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill
And I need to live my life because my time is unforgivable
I can't understand how my life changed around
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown on the grown?
Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision
Leaving in the car and much be spent on television
Oh girlfriend, get your mind on right
Don't spend your time 'cause you can't waste your time
Everyday like it's your last but you must feed the mind
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind
Love, you feel it and you got to let them know it
Love, your heart and that's the feeling that you go with
If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it
'Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
Carmen, don't listen 'cause the cards have deceit
Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt
Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling
He probably should be older
But the cards never lie, I thought I told you
Now it's her turn to try, to reach her goals
Before she reaches the light
This is love
It's like I'm trying to throw my life away
Sometimes love is all you got
And other times it makes you pay
Well, when you finally rise
Then you'll realize
The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes
Oh you could wish on the stars but they dead, just a lie
But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go
Just, just, just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
Its only beginning to find release
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice, you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago
Oh I'm screaming out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known
Now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice, you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I am done believing you
You don't know not what I am feeling
I'm more than what you've made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I got to find my own, my own
Thirteen years of solid gold platters
Rising cost and cocktail chatter
Fat DJ's, stereophonic sound, oh baby
The game of hits goes 'round and around
But you can fake your way to the top
'Round and around
Try that part right there, baby
('Round and around)
Fake your way to the top
('Round and around)
Now you fell right in there
Didn't you, sweetheart?
You can fake your way to the top
('Round and around)
Shit, I knew you'd have it, baby
But it's always real, so real
(Always so real)
When you're comin' down
I know what's happenin', I've been around
Makin' my way through every town
I make my livin' off of my sound
And the game of hits goes 'round and around
And around and around
And 'round and around
And 'round and around
'Round and around
And 'round and around
And 'round and around
And 'round and around
I made it slowly
Worked hard on the road
He's away from his lover
It's a heavy load
Time to bring up the lights, yeah
Now let's see which one of these girls
Goin' home with Jimmy tonight, yeah
I got a nice, warm bed waitin' on ya
Jimmy, my bed
Alright now, come on now
Who wants to sit on daddy's lap?
Break it down
I faked my way to the top
('Round and around)
Oh, yeah, yes, I did
('Round and around)
I said, I faked my way to the top
('Round and around)
('Round and around)
You know I faked my way to the top
('Round and around)
Yeah, yeah, oh yes, I did
('Round and around)
And it's always real, so real
(Oh, it's so real)
Baby, when you're comin' down
I faked my way, yes, I did
Help me, Jesus
(Help me, Jesus)
Help, help, help
(Help, help, help, help, help, help, help)
Help me, Jesus
(Help me, Jesus)
(Help, help, help, help, help, help, help)

I'd rather be with you
Boy I'd rather be with you (I'd rather be with you)
I don't want nobody else but you
I'd rather be with you because I love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because you hustle hard (I'd rather be with you babe)
To take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy I'd rather be with you (I'd rather be with you)
Boy I'd rather be with you
Here I am looking in the mirror
An open face, the pain erased
Now the sky is clearer, I can see the sun
Now that all is, all is said and done, oh
There you are always strong when I need you
You let me give and now I live
Fearless and protected with the one I will love
After all is, all is said and done
I once believed that hearts were made to bleed
(Inside I once believed that hearts were made to bleed, oh baby)
But now I'm not afraid to say
I need you, I need you so stay with me
These precious hours
(Precious, yeah)
Greet each dawn in open arms
And dream, into tomorrow
Where there's only love
After all is, all is said and done
(Yeah baby)
Oh baby
(Inside I once believed, that hearts were meant to bleed)
(I'll never)
I'll never be afraid to say
I need you, I need you, so here
So here we are in the still of this moment
Fear is gone, hope lives on
We found our happy ending
For there's only love
(Only love)
And this sweet, sweet love
After all is, all is said and done
Yeah baby, after all is
(All is)
All is said and done
Every step I make
And every breath I take
I took 'cause I can't wait
To be closer to you
Baby, you're so sweet
You give me cavities
I get a stomach ache
If I can't be with you
At night I fall asleep
And I don't want to wake up
'Cause you are in my dreams
A heavenly creation
In the body that
I only want to share with you
Hey
[Chorus]
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Baby, we will never finish
To be continued
Separation can't change
The love I feel for you
I'm gonna definitely be affectionate
Snuggle up tonight--let's get real intimate
'Cause only you can satisfy my appetite
'Cause when it comes to love
You get me get so excited
When I taste your lips
My body melts in bliss every time
[Chorus: x2]
You are my (you are my)
Universe (universe)
Everything I want and
Everything I need and
Everything worth waiting for
For better or for worse
Constant craving
Your love enslaves me, oh
[Chorus]
Give it to me, baby
I want to give it to you
Give it to me, baby
I can't wait
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
I can't wait
'Cause everything I do is just for you
Everything I do is just for you
Countin' every second till we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'Cause everything I do is just for you

Ring the alarm, I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm, I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Hit in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
In the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
Tell me how should I feel when I know what I know
And my female intuition tellin' me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations what you mean you gon' choke
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spendin' your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Hit in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
In the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
Ring the alarm, I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm, I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Tell me how should I feel when you made me belong
And the thought of you just touchin' her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on
He's so arrogant and bold
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma 'cause
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Hit in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
In the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
Ooh, how can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you
Ooh, why would you risk it babe
Is that the price that I pay, ooh
But this is my show, and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats, if I let you go
Hit in the house off the coast, if I let you go
She gon' take everything I own, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones, if I let you go
In the 'Bach or the Rolls, if I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught, if I let you go
I can't let you go, damn, if I let you go

A gift from Virgo (from Virgo)
I wish I could look in your eyes
And tell you how I feel right now inside
Baby, I know that it's real
So real, so real, so real
How I wish I could be with you
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now
Every morning, every afternoon, every night
I want to be with you
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play, stay in the hotel room all day
I just want to be with you
I love everything about you from your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when you're dancing with me
Do you remember our first kiss?
It wasn't long enough
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together
They were not long enough
All of our conversations
All of your sweet pages
They're never long enough
When it's time for me to leave
It's so hard to say goodbye
I never want to say goodbye
I never ever want to say goodbye
One day we'll make love
Finally I'll be yours
Only you, only you
I could love you
It's too late
I already love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you, I love you
Baby, I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation in connection to the sun
With you next to me there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you and God who's the sunlight I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and mixed-up world
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
And I know you love me, love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am, baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife and I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you sometimes make me want to cry
Realize all my blessings; I'm grateful to have you by my side
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
Every time I see your face my heart smiles
Every time it feels so good it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold
To feel, to breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me (dangerously)
Dangerous, dangerously in love

I wanted to give all of my fans something extra
Because this album was so special to me
And it came so effortlessly after I finished
The film of my life 'Dreamgirls'
Because I was so inspired by Deena
I wrote songs that were saying all the things
I wish she woulda said in the film
And I wanted to give you an extra special song
That Deena sings, it's a pivotal moment
When Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself
And does know who she is, and knows what she wants
I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics
This is Listen
The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got (tell me more)
Your love has captured me
Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
When all the while inside
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel
Lying here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
Let's give love a try (let's give love a try)
Sweeter than sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts in love will find
True love in a special way
The closer I get to you, baby
The more you make me see (the more you make me see)
By giving me what you've got
Your love captured me
Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
When all the while inside
I knew this was real (got to be real)
The way you make me feel (you know, you know, you know)
My baby, my baby, my baby, my love, my love, my love, my love
(Come closer love) Come a little closer so that we can see into the eyes of love
I wanna see into those eyes of love
(Come closer love) Just a little a closer let me speak to you
I want to softly tell you something
Here I am, here's my love; I just want you to come closer
Come a little closer, let me whisper in your ear
'Cause I want to tell you something
I wanna whisper in your ear so soft, so come closer love
Move on in real close so we can celebrate the way we feel about each other's lovin'
Wanna tell you words, words of love, words that make you wanna
When I First met u
U told me exactly how it would be
U had a lady
And couldn't spend all ur time with me
I only wanted to kick it
So i said boo u can keep her
Long as u satisfy me
But as the weeks went by
I, I started feeling strange
Sumthin was deep in my heart
Sumthin I can't explain
I think I'm fallin in love with u boy
I'm needin u so much
I'm cryin just 2 feel ur touch
I gotta leave u
I didn't wanna a man
I didn't wanna fall in love and
I didn't care about ur girl
I didn't care how we would end up
But that was then this is now
I think i'm experiencing love
I don't wanna wreck up ur home
That's y i'm convinced

When I First met u

Baby I see you
That look in your eyes
Hips that keep shaking
mysterious style
exotically tempting
familiar to me
That Creole Sexy it's all over me
So all my redbones get on the floor
and all my yellow bones get on the floor
and all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and call it Creole
[Repeat 2x]
Creole! When I look real good
Whenever I talk real good

So all my redbones get on the floor
and all my yellow bones get on the floor

Then you mix it up and call it Creole
[Repeat 2x]

Beyonce you can do so much better
[Verse]
You say that he's wrong
You say that he's no good
Leave him alone
'cause he's gonna hurt you
But what they don't know is how he makes me feel
You say that he creeps
Always running the streets
He's playing the game
And he'll never love me
You say that he's fake
But why does it feel so real
[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think I'ma always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
(The love that we share it lives inside of me)
No matter what you hear-ing, its all in the past
No matter what you feel-ing his love is gon last
The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me
(The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me)
[Chorus]
He's my man
(He makes me feel so special)
My man
(He makes me feel so precious)
My man
(He makes me feel wonderful)
My man
(With him I'm so comfotable)
My man
(He makes me feel so special)
My man
(He makes me feel so precious)
My man
(He makes me feel wonderful)
He's thuged out but he's my man
[Verse]
You say you don't trust him
Be'cause he's been locked up
You say he in trouble
'cause he out in a strip club
But you were young once
So you should understand
You say that you know
Say you've been a witness
You say it's for sure
Say he got a mistress
Until you can show me
I'm gon stand by him
[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think I'ma always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
(The love that we share it lives inside of me)
No matter what you hear-ing, its all in the past
No matter what you feel-ing his love is gon last
The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me
(The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me)
[Chorus]
He's my man
(He makes me feel so special)
My man
(He makes me feel so precious)
My man
(He makes me feel wonderful)
My man
(With him I'm so comfotable)
My man
(He makes me feel so special)
My man
(He makes me feel so precious)
My man
(He makes me feel wonderful)
He's thuged out but he's my man

But for a girl spendin' time alone can be pretty rough
But I get a knock on my door
I know it's yours for sure
We can't wait for the bedroom, so we just hit the floor
[Chorus]

Come on, child, blow your horn now
So we're shakin' back and forth now

But in the back of my mind
Is it gonna be the last time?
Well, if it ain't about lovin' and you gon' keep it comin'
Well, baby, with me that's fine

Child, blow your horn now
Come on, child, blow your horn now

Oh, oh, hey

I'm feeling foxy 'cause, boy, you're workin' it out
My love, you've given me a taste of your honey

Island hoppin' off the Amalfi coast

Out of all the guys that approach me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited awhile and took your time
You dont know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I
I wanted more than just a man, I needed a friend
Someone I can talk to, someone who really listens
When you touched my hand, the sun got brighter then
Trusting you, I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
Now its been a year and were closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside for me
And now you are my prize
Wanna grow old witcha
And fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together well raise a family
Baby, youre more than just a man, you are my best friend
Someone I can talk to someone who really listens
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then
Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
Ooh, ooh, ahh
Star, star
I'm wishing
I'm wishing
On a star
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see
I'm wishing on the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow rain never comes
And I'm wishing on all of the things we never done
I never thought I'd see the time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we spent
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
In the game of love, you reap what you sow
(Sow)
I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together whether or never
I feel, it's time we should make up baby
I feel, it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
(Let's get together, baby)
Whether or never
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see
I'm wishing on the people who really dream
Hoping all the days to come and days to go
Hoping on the days of loving, loving you so
Wishing on a star, wishing on a dream
Baby, forgive me
Lets make up, I'm sorry
Lets be together, breakup? Never
The love we have seems special so far
'Til we get back, I'm wishing on a star
Chorus
[B] Yo where the brother by my side at?
[M] Yo you really need to stop that
[B] Get it right!
[M] It's not even like that
[B] Try to get a job before we livin outta box black
[M]Put it on that and here's ya demo you can shop dat
[Beyonce]
It's funny how things turn around
Last night you tryna get down you act like you down
Any other time it's like you steady hatin on Brown
I'm tryna see my name in lights you tryna short it out the ground
[Mekhi]
You're the one that's got it twisted cause I'm right by your side
I had a bad day you jumpin' on my back for a ride
What can a man say I'm on the run, just for your auditionin
Callin on you every night it's like you never listenin
[Beyonce]
You're the one that's switchin up gettin to specifics
When you say that I'm just dreamin I be rollin like a Misholin (?)
[Mekhi]
Carmen you just trippin cause you know I love you infinite
Just so we could be here look at everything I did for this
[Beyonce]
So why you actin like that
You don't have to take it anymore fight back
I came to far to turn around and just hike back
Trying to get me sidetracked see me on the corner where the sign of the time
at
Chorus x2
[Beyonce]
And yo I came from the projects now I want the condos
Trying to be a star and now you messin up my cosmo
[Mekhi]
But you can't find something if you walkin' wit a blindfold
Carmen I can see right through you with my eyes closed
[B]Grown man to finance
[M]You actin like a nuisance
[B]You're the one that's in the club and tryin to do a new dance
[Mekhi]
Songs you got me singin like my name was Bobbly Blubland
Don't make me sing 'em cause the game you playin baby two can
All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out
I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think
She was from your past
Silly of me to dream of
One day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when its wrong
I can't believe I fell for four years
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me
You're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete
When you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I've moved on
'Cause I realized I got
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm a be my own best friend
Me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now
I'm a be my own best friend
Your so controlling, you say that you love me
But you don't
Your family told me one day
I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing
With your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when its wrong
Now that its over
Stop calling me
Come pick up yo clothes
No need to front like ya still wit me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong
'Cause I realized I got
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm a be my own best friend
I got me, myself, and I
Must have cried a thousand times
I can't regret time spent with you
But I lucked out to make it through
I wish I could believe you
Then I'll be alright
But now ev'rything you told me
Really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Lovin' you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you
And I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you
I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can, and I
I tried and I tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment
I'll always remember feelin'
Like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you
Like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than ever
More than my own life
The best part of me I gave you
It was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I tried and I tried to forgive this
But I'm damn too full of resentment
I know she was attractive
But I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you, you?
I know you're prob'ly thinkin'
What's up with B?
I've been cryin' for too long
What did you do to me?
I used to be so strong
But now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin'
Can't stop cryin'
You could've told me that you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
Look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes
And see she's had half of me
How could you lie?
(You lied)
Out of all the guys that approach me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited awhile and took your time
You dont know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I
I wanted more than just a man, I needed a friend
Someone I can talk to, someone who really listens
When you touched my hand, the sun got brighter then
Trusting you, I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
Now its been a year and were closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside for me
And now you are my prize
Wanna grow old witcha
And fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together well raise a family
Baby, youre more than just a man, you are my best friend
Someone I can talk to someone who really listens
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then
Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my mine name that is on that tag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
And call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I am such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I'll have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So since Im not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you, I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is replacing you is so easy
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute
You could pack all your things, we're finished
(You must not know 'bout me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
(You must not know 'bout me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
Took me a while but I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out to be picked on
Talked about, out my friends mouths
I've been beat down til He turned my life around
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I used to wake up somedays
And wish I'd stayed asleep
Cause I went to bed on top of the world
Today the world's on top of me
Now everybody's got opinions
They ain't been in my position
That it breaks my heart
When I hear what they have to say about me
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
And I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned by the world
If I don't succeed
Cause I aint good enough
But He still loves me
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed to be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cause through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without pain?
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still love me
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned by the world
If I dont succeed
Cause I aint good enough
But He still loves me
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned be the word
If I don't succeed
Cause I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I aint good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
(But the Lord still loves me)
I love you
I love you, I love you
Baby, I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation in connection to the sun
With you next to me there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you and God who's the sunlight I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and mixed-up world
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
And I know you love me, love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am, baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife and I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you sometimes make me want to cry
Realize all my blessings; I'm grateful to have you by my side
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
Every time I see your face my heart smiles
Every time it feels so good it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold
To feel, to breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you loving me
'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free

A-town's up, deuces down it's the new call
And you can dial 1-888-cut-something
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna something
Ain't no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I'm a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian but under the sheets

Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll with Hip Hop
Bamboos on, pants down low I'm a rock star

Undress me, undress me, you can come
Come baby, undress me
Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them drippin' down they sugar walls

Knocking boots in stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!
A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! spit game!
Venom to get it up in 'em, let me "p" pop that thang

My nails, my hair, my diamond rings
Shining with all my fancy things
My crib, my car, my clothes, my jewels
Why you mad, cause I came up and I ain't changed
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
(* Beyonce in the background *)
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh!
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh!
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh!
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh!
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh!
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh!
And you should love it, way more than you hate it
Oh, you mad, I thought you should be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
Move out the hood now you tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my junk get to pumpin' in da club it's on
I wink my eye at ya chick, if she smile, she gone
If the roof on fire, man, just let it burn
If you talkin' about money, homie I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me, 'cause go head, switch the style up
And if they hate, then let 'em hate, and watch the money pile up
Or we go upside they head with a bottle of bub
C'mon, ain't know where we be..
[Chorus 2x: Beyonce]
You can find me in da club, sippin' on some bub
Daddy I got what you need, you a sexy little thug
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin for no love
So come give me a hug, you a sexy little thug
[Outro: 50 Cent]
Hahaha
Don't try to act like you don't know where we been either
We in da club all the time, it's about to pop off
Hahaha
Beyonce' - You know you really, really, really, really,
want to be with me
So why don't you stop beating around the bush
and come and give it to me
Derek we can make beautiful music together
if you only stop resisting the only woman that you really want
and its not wifey
Mekhi - Hey! You're real social
I don't like the way you're looking
Don't get too close
I'm about to take you down to booking
Beyonce' - C'mon and touch me D I know you want to
Mekhi - Look, I only need your prints,
don't really care about your frontal
Beyonce' - I don't see me living another day
without your tender kisses
Why don't we retire to the room,
put on some Luther, light some incents
Get to know one another just a little better
than we do now
Mekhi - You trying to act like I'm not a cop
Beyonce' - You can bring the cuffs, if you would like to,
if that's your style
Mekhi - Looks let's get it straight, you cease and disist
I got some platinum bracelets
I'm about to squeeze on ya wrists
Beyonce' - But you don't understand the way that I feel,
the pain I could heal
Mekhi - I could lose my job for this,
there is no way we could chill
Beyonce' - So why you bring me this far,
now let's try to be real
Cause only time will reveal
if you still playing the field
Every second that you stay is like an hour we will
I got a couple days to kill,
either you down or you peel
I don't want anything without you in my life,
you are my baby
Why don't you forget about your girl
and say you want me as your lady
Get to know one another just a little better
than we do now
Give in to everything you're feeling that's surprising
Let's make love now
Mekhi - Nah, I don't think so,
your body is like weed smoke though
Light-headed, feel ya eyes saying please don't go
Beyonce' - It ain't about getting locked
cause it's your steeze I need
My heart don't lie, come over D and feel my beat
Mekhi - Oh no! Cause I can see your skin is soft
You know, but I dont wanna pay the cost to be with you
Beyonce' - You can't deny your feelings for us,
you know it's true
Mekhi - I gotta girl, but really now I'm feeling you
I wanna do it, but I don't
You know, I'd feel your vibe, but I'm so full of decency
Beyonce' - Go with your instints and I'm sure it leads to me
There's only one way to see if it is to be...
Baby, seem like everywhere I go I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you
Boy, I try to catch myself but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go, baby
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Baby, I can't go anywhere without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true, gotta be having deja vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here, get on the next plane, I don't care
I'm missing you, that I'm having deja vu
Boy, I try to catch myself but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu

They say "Stay away from them gangstas"
They never change up, or pull they pants up
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down
Don't let'em push you around, you know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt grown before
This can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know whatcha feel like for instance
They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos and the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you, it's just my Clyde
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
That's why my minds, they like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche
But of course
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
Young Hova and the letter B
How you like that, huh?
That's how you like it, huh
That's how you like it, huh (I like it baby)
That's how you like it, huh (I like it baby)

(VERSE 1)
Its really being weighing on me
Tell me what did i do
To have yall hatin on me
When i dont have nothin to prove
Sometimes i shake my head when im laying down in my bed
Thinking about the things being said when you really dont know me
(HOOK)
Gotta clear up somethings there have been many things said about me
So many opinions so many judgements preconceived
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya,give it a rest
You must admire me spend so much time with me consuming your head
(CHORUS)
I cant take nomore
Think its time for me to let it all out
I cant take nomore
Why my name always up in your mouth
What you hate me for
Im so tired all of these lie
I cant take nomore nomore nomore
(VERSE 2)
Its really been weighing on me
Im not myself lately
I feel a little incomplete
But im not gon loose no sleep
I keep it all in my mind
Cause it gotta get better in time
Why dont you live your life and let me live mine
(HOOK)
(CHORUS)
You,you,you dont know (repeat 4xs)
(CHORUS)(repeat 2xs)
Leave me alone,leave me alone
Just leave me alone,leave me alone

Just leave me alone,leave me alone
I love you

Baby I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation In connection to the sun
With you next to me There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrop I am the sea
With you and God,who's my sunlight I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud so proud to be your girl
You make the confusion Go all away
From this cold and messed up world
[Chorus]
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me
And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am Baby you
Were my man
I know it ain't easy Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny I see myself having
Your child I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful To have you by my side
[Chorus]
Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world To love, to hold, To
Feel, To breathe, To love you
Dangerously in love
[Chorus]
Dangerously,
Dangerous,
Dangerously in love with you
Oh I love you I love you I love you I love
You...
Hey yo, B

Bad Boy, baby, uh
Hey yo, B
I've been wanting to explain to you what it is that you do to me
Got me open, I am so in love with loving you
Touching places, no one else has ever made me feel incredible
When you touch me, I feel sexy, no one else like you
Got me going off all the love you give me
I'd be crazy to ever want to leave
I love the way your hands belong over there
Please don't say you're gonna stop loving me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, when you're giving your love to me

Ohh, the way you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me
I lose all control when you are here and baby, it amazes me
How could someone be so sexy and love like you do
Oh baby, do you understand the power that you posses over me
Can't accept this feeling and I don't think I want to
Got me going off all the love you give me
I'd be crazy to ever want to leave
I love the way your hands belong over there
Please don't say you're gonna stop loving me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, when you're giving your love to me
Ohh, it's like you're making love to me

It's all 'cause you love me the way you do
Don't want no other love but you
'Cause no one else has ever made me feel this good
Ohh, keep giving your love to me
Ohh, keep giving your love to me

And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my mine name that is on that tag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard telling me

Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me

So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
And call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I am such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

chorus till fade
I said yes to your number and yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together but you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never said yes)
I said yes we can be together, yes you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight, you actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never said yes)
You was on the wall
I was with my crew
You was watchin' me baby
I was watchin' you
Slowly you walked over
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me, I
Said hello to you
You ask me where I'm from
I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye
I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night
So I gave my number to you
I said yes to your number and yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together but you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never said yes)
I said yes we can be together, yes you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight, you actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never
Certainly you can call me baby
I love to hear from you
Yes of course you can come and see me boy
I wanna get to know you more, sure I'm feelin' you
No baby, not yet, we can't take that next step
Why you getting so upset, boy you
Act as though I never told you yes before
You are so ungrateful
You was at my house
I was sittin on my couch
You was really buggin' so I
Told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve, you
Too damn old to be so immature, I hope you learn
You said I move too slow, I
I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later
I said don't call no more
It is cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
'Cause you show me your true face baby
The first time I said no
I said yes to your number and yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together but you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never said yes)
I said yes we can be together, yes you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight, you actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never said yes before)
I said yes to your number and yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together but you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes (it's like I never
Beyonce' - Sweetness flowing like a faucet
Body bangin' up corset
Brothas wanna toss it
But they lost, cause my game made them forfeit
Slicker than a porpis and thicker than a horses
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I'll stick to my thesis, I'll stick to my features
Brothas trying to hold, but thier game never reaches
Most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you looking at, but what you looking at?
You in a bar, wanna twist me like a bottle cap
Mos Def - I'm trying to holla Miss, to see if you gonna holla back
Beyonce' - Your game is whack, and know you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunkin that
Mos Def - But this is Miller, Lieutenant, if you're wondering
Sarpong - And I'm the thag
Mos Def - Mel Gibson
Sarpong - Danny Gloverin'
Beyonce' - But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumbling
See, I have dreams with a man, what will become of him?
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should post pone my goals, he got tricks up his sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down
Mos Def - I got a warrant for ya heart and a bedroom and trial
Sarpong - Get a pardon if you come with the Sergeant, now
Beyonce' - Give me a chair, cause I don't care, I ain't feeling your style
Chorus
Mos Def - Yo, I'm trying to get with you shorty
Beyonce' - But I'm not feeling you
Sarpong - But I'm an officer shorty
Beyonce' - My looks are killing you
Mos Def - Murder One will get you under the covers
Beyonce' - Game taller, man slaughter, I ain't feeling you brothas
Mos Def - Yo, I'm trying to get with you shorty
Beyonce' - But I'm not feeling you
Sarpong - But I'm an officer shorty
Beyonce' - My looks are killing you
Mos Def - Murder One will get you under the covers
Beyonce' - Game taller, man slaughter, I ain't feeling you brothas
Eyes like the ocean
Mos Def - Ma, I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise 'em high and daddy long stroke you
Beyonce' - Hair like forever
Sarpong - Swear I could do it better
Take my gun out the holster, I still got the Barretta
Beyonce' - Brothas sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing, but that kid...
Mos Def - Don't waste your time, he ain't no doing, he's just a Sergeant
Passing out tickets for parking
Sarpong - Chickenheads clucking
Beyonce' - Pitiful bulls barking
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as marvin
I turn out lights, with the switch, when I'm walking
Girls getting jealous, cause they man always hawking
Even got Lou looking at me like he stalking
And I got a mind too
I wouldn't bless you,
if your first name was "Hachu" on Sunday singing gospel
Mos Def - You ain't a dime, just a nickel acting hostel
Beyonce' - I'm headed for the big time , I'm bouncing on this side-show...
Do you think
You could fall for a woman like me
'Cause I find it hard to trust
I need too much
And I really don't believe in love, no, no
Do you think
That I could be the girl of your dreams
Sometimes I don't let things go
Get emotional
And sometimes I'm just out of control
You need to stop for a minute
Before you get too, deep up in it
(Too deep)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
(Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(No, no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
Do you think
That I could be the one that you seek
'Cause baby I'm one step ahead
You're two steps behind
But baby I don't mind
Do you think
That I can make you real happy baby
Just don't get me wrong
My loving is so strong
But I ain't tryna lead you on
You need to stop for a minute
(No, no)
Before you get too, deep up in it
(No, no)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
(Seems)
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
(Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(Without it)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Oh
You need to stop for a minute
(Stop for a minute)
Before you get too, deep up in it
(Before you get too deep up in it)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
You need to think about it
(Think about it, baby)
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(No, no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
You're holding me and I close my eyes
You're whispering, and I start to cry
You feel so good, so beautiful
For as long as you live don't let me go
Just hold me, touch me, feel me
As long as you love me, reach for me and need me
If you could trust me, and teach me, never let go of me
Because you're half of me, my heart still beats
I'm looking in the eyes, the eyes of love
And I hold your face and I see the sun
I taste your kiss, you touch my soul
and I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Just hold me, touch me, feel me
As long as you love me, reach for me and need me
If you could trust me, and teach me, never let go of me
Because you're half of me my heart still beats
I'm feeling what they call pure love
I never knew feeling like this could exist inside of me
I'm soaring, emotions exploding
I don't want to live another day if you're not here with me
Just hold me, touch me, feel me
As long as you love me, reach for me and need me
If you could trust me, teach me, never let go of me
Because you're half of me my heart still beats
because you're half of me my heart still beats
It doesn't matter where you been
Or what you did wrong
It doesn't matter who you are
You're always welcome
It only matters that your heart believes
And you confess
If you committed any sin you'll be forgiven
Callin on all of God's children

If you cant see your way out
And you're drowning in your regrets
If you have everything you want
But you still cant find happiness
'cause when you feel like you're forsaken
Life can be so hopeless
Maybe you need to come home
So your life can be planned
Oooh
God's children
Time to come home
If you wanna be delivered
Time to come home
I've been rescued by the savior
Time to come home
If you wanna be

Come unto him and he will give you rest
For any heart that's heavy laden for salvation

Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it
Boy I try to catch myself but I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing I can't let it go!
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you

No dejÐ° vu, just me and my... oh!
Beyonce:
Baby I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true

Out of all the guys that approach me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited awhile and took your time
You dont know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I
I wanted more than just a man, I needed a friend
Someone I can talk to, someone who really listens
When you touched my hand, the sun got brighter then
Trusting you, I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
Now its been a year and were closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside for me
And now you are my prize
Wanna grow old witcha
And fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together well raise a family
Baby, youre more than just a man, you are my best friend
Someone I can talk to someone who really listens
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then
Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime, summertime
To be or not to be, not!
Hold up, bring the beat back
Stop! I aint ready yet
Wait! Let me fix my hair, yes, yes
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am
Now pass me my dress, yes

Been locked up in the house way too long

Soon as he saw me
Turned on by how the dress was fittin' right
Short and backless
See my silhouette in the moonlight
Such an attraction
Keep tellin' me how my outfits so nice
Little did he know
Ha, my man gon' take it off tonight
'Cause when he acts up, thats when you put it on
Get him uptight, this is your song
Hold out your back, time to impress

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you
[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secret, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Going through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'mma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one
[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy
[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you
[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se
[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you
[Bridge]
Oh it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard
[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy
[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you
[Outro]
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
nan
Yee-haw
Oh, oh, oh
Texas, texas (oh, oh, oh) texas
Came into this world
Daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me
Oh, oh, oh
Daddy made me dance
And daddy held my hand
Oh, oh, oh
And daddy liked his whisky with his tea
And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
Oh, and that's when he gave to me...
With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh
Daddy made me fight
It wasn't always right
But he said girl it's your second amendment, oh, oh, oh
He always played it cool
But daddy was no fool
And right before he died he said remember...
He said take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
And that's when daddy looked at me...
With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you
Cause when trouble comes in town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Cause when trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
(Good job Bey, hahaha)
Forward
Best foot first just in case
When we made our way 'til now
It's time to listen, it's time to fight
Forward
Now we're going to hold doors open for a while
Now we can be open for a while
Forward
I love you more than this job, please don't work for me
Forward
Go back to your sleep in your favorite spot just next to me
Forward, forward

Who the fuck do you think I is?
You ain't married to no average bitch boy

I am the dragon breathing fire
Beautiful mane I'm the lion

We just got to let it be

When you hurt me, you hurt yourself

[Outro: BeyoncÃ©]
We just got to let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be baby

You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation
Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper
Girl, I hear some thunder
Golly, look at that water, boy, oh lord
Found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime
Seen your scars and kissed your crime
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
All night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long
Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light
If you get deep, you touch my mind
If you get deep, you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again

We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long
They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Oh nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became a remedy
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up

Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry

He trying to roll me up, I ain't picking up
Headed to the club, I ain't thinking 'bout you
Me and my ladies sip my D'USSÃ cup
I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause, I had enough
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout
Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye
Tell him, boy, bye, middle fingers up
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah

It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry

Middle fingers up, I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry

I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry

No no, hell nah
Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair
[Verse]
We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way
Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way
And your heart is broken cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no no no no no
Every promise don't work out that way
Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'm a wall, come and march on the regular
Painting white flags blue
Lord forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Singin', freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof
Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Singin', freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves
Ten Hail Mary's, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm moving backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleading statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights waving in my direction
5-O asking me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep running, jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guiding me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Singing, freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
Hear me out
I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to cool myself off. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' you catch me
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory
It don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
[Chorus: BeyoncÃ©]
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
You know, pesos out of Mexico
De uno, commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy, oh no
She already made enough but she'll never leave
[Chorus: BeyoncÃ©]
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
[Post-Chorus: BeyoncÃ©]
She works for the money, she work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar
And she worth every minute
She works for the money
She works for the money
She works for the money
She works for the money
[Verse 2: BeyoncÃ©]
She stack her money, money everywhere she goes
She got that Sake, her Yamazaki straight from Tokyo
Oh baby you know, she got them commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up cause she professional
[Chorus: BeyoncÃ©]
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
[Post-Chorus: BeyoncÃ©]
She works for the money, she work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar
And she worth every minute
[Bridge: BeyoncÃ©]
Stars in her eyes
She fights for the power, keeping time
She grinds day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday
She gon' slang
She too smart to crave material things
She pushing herself day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday
Oh, stars in her eyes
She fights and she sweats those sleepless nights
But she don't mind, she loves the grind
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday
Yeah, yeah, she gon' slang
Too smart to crave material things
Stacking her paper
Stacking her cake up
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday
[Chorus: BeyoncÃ©]
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
[Post-Chorus: BeyoncÃ©]
She works for the money, she work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar
And she worth every minute
[Outro: BeyoncÃ©]
Oh, gonna make you feel
You always come back to me
Come back, come back
Come back, come back
Come back, come back, come back
Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times outta ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed
I'm movin' on
I'll always be committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me would stop this love drought
[Beyonce:]
What goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
There was a time
I thought, that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy I, must've been outta my mind
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed you ass and I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
So baby good lookin' out
[Chorus]
I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
I bet it sucks to be you right now
[Avery Storm:]
It's so hard that you're hurt
When we both know don't act like you never cared
I don't deserve your tears
Cause I did put them there
Think that everytime that you said I love you
You showed your ass girl that wasn't the real you
Too bad you blew it
Too bad you couldn't put the work in
You gave up on us
When we should have worked it out
[Beyonce:]
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time, another world, another life
Thank God I found the good in goodbye
[Chorus]
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through it that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the, best thing you never had.
Best thing you never had!
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now
Goes around, comes back around
Goes around, comes back around
Bet it sucks to be you right now
Goes around, comes back around
Bet it sucks to be you right now
Goes around, comes back around
Bet it sucks to be you right now

(Verse 1)
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a real work)
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first
(chorus)
Baby it's you.
You're the one I love.
You're the one I need.
You're the only one I see.
Come on baby it's you.
You're the one that gives your all.
You're the one I can always call.
When I need you make everything stop.
Finally you put my love on top.
Ooh! Come on baby.
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top.
You put my love on top.
Ooh oooh! Come on baby.
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top.
My love on top.
My love on top.
(Verse 2)
Baby, Baby
I can hear the wind whipping past my face.
As we dance the night away.
Boy your lips taste like a night of champagne.
As i kiss you again and again and again and again.
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a real work)
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my tears.
And finally you put me first.
Baby it's you.
You're the one I love.
You're the one I need.
You're the only one I see.
Come on baby it's you.
You're the one that gives your all.
You're the one I can always call.

Finally you put my love
Love on top
Boy you'll be the death of me
You're my James Dean
You make me feel like I'm seventeen
You drive too fast, you smoke too much
But that don't mean a thing
'cause i'm addicted to the rush
'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you
You know i've been in love before
You're the first one ever seen
That burns like gasoline
So light a match, turn off the lights
I'm holding on to you
'cause this might be a last night, oh
'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you
What i'm telling you
I'm giving you my life, it's in your hands
And what i'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what we've been through
I rather give up everything
Than to live my life without you
Oh!
Oh!
'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you

I wanna leave my footprint on the sands of time
Know there was something that, meant something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets,
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I want to say I lived each day, until I die
And know that I meant something in somebody's life
The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone to happiness
Left this world a little better just because
I was here
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done, everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here.
(I lived), I lived
(I loved), I was here
(I did), I did
(I've done), I was here
(I lived), I lived
(I loved)
I was here
(I did), I did
(I've done)
I was here
Don't you worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight
I was out shopping thinking of something I should get you
'Cause I been gone so many weeks damn I miss you
Don't wanna do nothin' more than just stare at your face
And let you know I'm happy you're my best friend
Part of this fortune boy I owe you
For being always here to talk to
Taking time out starting with the day for my babe
We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be our light tonight
And Imma DJ all of your songs
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club
Just come lay up under me tonight
Boy, if you just call I'm on my way
When it comes to my baby I bring my best
It's just you and me all night
Don't worry 'bout no club
Just lay up under me tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Don't worry 'bout a club
Just come lay up under me
Let's pop a bottle of that vintage that I bought you
I model sexy pictures right on top of you
10 years together still feels like we're making love for the first time
Like I'm in high school sneaking with my boyfriend
Part of this fortune boy I owe you
For being always there to talk to
Taking time out starting with the day for my babe
We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be our light tonight
Boy Imma DJ all of your songs
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club
Just lay up under me tonight
We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be our light tonight
Boy Imma DJ all of your songs
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight
Boy if you just call I'm on my way
When it comes to my baby I bring my best
I just wanna party tonight
'Cause its obvious to see that you're where I wanna be
Just let me look at you
Ooh you look so sexy boy I want a taste
You already know which way
When I groove with you
Ooh you feel so good boy you're my favorite place
Just come and lay under me
We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be our light tonight
Imma DJ all of your songs
You ain't gotta worry 'bout no club
Just lay up under me
2x
Tonight, tonight, tonight,
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club
Just lay up under me tonight

Got a lot to learn in this love

Dedicated to the one of love, hey
Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sang
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the brain
I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time
Do whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line
Me and my boo in my boo coupe ridin'
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it
Me and my boo in my boo coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it
Oh, killing me softly and I'm still fallin'
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever get me though
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me you're out of your mind

All up in the store, shorty, trickin' if I want to
All up in the store, shorty, fly as we want to
Ooo ooo ooo ooo
Damn I think I love that boy
Do anything for that boy
Boy -oy -oy -oy!

It's you and me until the end

Ladies, if you love your man show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it
Me and my boo and my boo lip locking
All up in the back because the chicks keep flocking

Oh, killing me softly and I'm still fallin'
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever get me though
Say it real loud if you fly

Still the 1
I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you, why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you, around
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same
Words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean em, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, why is that?
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same
It don't matter who you are
It's so simple, a feeling
But it's everything no matter who you love
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same
It don't matter who you are
It's so simple, a feeling
But it's everything no matter who you love
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything

(But see the guys at the party!)
[Chorus:]
Ain't nothing out there for me
Ain't nothing about there for me
This is where I want to be
I dun already been in the streets
And I ain't came across nothin' so sweet
He's the only man that I love
And I don't need more than one
So don't worry when I'm hanging out
He's the only one that I am thinking about!
I know he's insecure
Every time I leave out the door
(and you letting him spoil your night? Live your life, you ain't even his wife)
He ain't gotta worry about me
Cause I got something more sweet

And I know I'm so lucky
Ain't nothin'
[Chorus]
[Repeat: x2]
And I love him

Rockin on you babe

Not even mention myself I don't care I'm with you, you with me
I never wished on a star when a star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in my dreams.
When I close my eyes I feel like I'm alive

If that's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong
oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.
I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me

I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
It's like I'm where I'm supposed to be.
When I close my eyes I feel like I'm alive
'cause I can fall asleep knowing that tonight you will be here with me, ohh.

It took a lifetime just to get with you, to be with you baby
And now that I'm here with you I'm gonna take it in breathe you in. Yeah yeah
And if I am dreaming, let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I rather dream about you than be living life wthout me and you. You...
(Let me know) If this is a dream (Oh Oh Oh)
Then I don't wanna know, (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you babe, (without you babe) ohh.

What goes around comes back around, hey, my baby
What goes around comes back around, hey, my, my baby
I say what goes around comes back around, hey, my baby
What goes around comes back around
There was a time I thought that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
So, baby, good lookin' out
I won't let you back
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
You turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
And I'm gonna always be the (best thing you never had)
Oh yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now
So sad, you're hurt
Boohoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
Baby, good lookin' out
I won't let you back
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
I said, you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
Mm, and I'll never be the (best thing you never had)
Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time Another world, another life
Thank God I found the good in goodbye
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
Oh, you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
And I will always be the (best thing you never had)
Ooh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that

But I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight
Boy im out of sight
And i'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life
Schoolin' life....oh oh oh....schoolin' life....
You know it costs to be the boss
One day you'll run the town
For now make your life what you decide
Baby, party til the fire marshal, shuts this sucker down
I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you something
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor
But I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight
Boy im out of sight
And i'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life
Schoolin' life....oh oh oh....schoolin' life....oh oh oh
There's not a real way to live this...for real
Just remember stay relentless....oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't stop running until it's finished
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten
If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston to New York to L.A
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time to make a change
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
You are alone, and I'd be a piss
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you bet all of you and wanted nothing else for me
But come back sometimes for you but else I met you was only
I couldn't see but now I know that I acted selfishly
I should of known that I let you down and caused you so much misery
And never to plea, and never to plea, and never to plea, and never to plea
All of the times you used to cry
Because I would let you down
All of the times I should of tried a little more to be around
But I didn't know you were hurting I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain another you I'll never find
I couldn't see but now I know that I acted selfishly
I should of known that I let you down and caused you so much misery
And never to plea, and never to plea, and never to plea, and never to plea.
I feel weak, we've been here before,
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth,
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through,
But I honestly can say I still love you,
Maybe we reached the mountain peak,
And there's no more left to climb,
And maybe we lost the magic piece,
And we're both too blind to find,
Let's start over,
Let's give love their wings,
Let's start over,
Stop fighting 'bout the same old thing,
Let's start over,
We can't let our good love die,
Maybe we can start over,
Give love another life,
I can see that we're not happy here,
So why would we keep pretending when there's nothing there?
Maybe you like it, well, I don't,
And maybe you'll settle, well, I won't,
Maybe we reached the mountain peak,
And there's no more left to climb,
And maybe we lost the magic piece,
And we're both too blind to find,
Let's start over,
Let's give love their wings,
Let's start over,
Stop fighting 'bout the same old thing,
Let's start over,
We can't let our good love die,
Maybe we can start over,
Give love another life,
I know that this will hurt you,
I know you'll cry,
I know I called you selfish, but that's a lie,
I feel I know that's the best for us,
Let's start over,
And let's give love their wings,
Let's start over,
I'm tired of fighting 'bout the same old thing,
Let's start over,
We both know that this love won't die,
Maybe we can start over,
And give love another life.

It's hot up in here
DJ don't be scared to run this, run this back
I'm repping for the girls who taking over the world
Have me raise a glass for the college grads
Anyone rolling I'll let you know what time it is
You can't hold me
I broke my 9 to 5 and copped my cheque
This goes out to all the women getting it in,
Get on your grind
To the other men that respect what I do
Please accept my shine
Boy you know you love it
How we're smart enough to make these millions
Strong enough to bare the children
Then get back to business
See, you better not play me
Don't come here baby
Hope you still like me
If you hate me!
[Bridge]
My persuasion can build a nation
In this hour
Our love we can devour
You'll do anything for me

[chorus]
I may be young but I'm ready
To give you all my love!
I told my girls you can get it,
Don't slow it down, just let it go
So in love I'll give it all away,
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow!
So tonight I'll do it every way,
Speakers knocking til the morning lights!
Chorus:
We like to party, hey, hey, hey! hey! hey! hey!
(We like to party!)
We like to party, hey, hey, hey! hey! hey! hey!
(We like to party!)
Your touch is driving me crazy,
I can't explain the way I feel!
Top down with the radio on
And the night belongs to us!
Just hold me close, don't let me go!
So in love! I don't care what they say!
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow!
Cause tonight is the night, oh, oh, oh
That I give you everything,
Music knocking til the morning light,
Cause we like to party!
Set the scene, 3000 degrees,
Ain't worried 'bout them fuck niggas over there,
But they worried 'bout me.
I got a homeboy name butter and another homeboy that nigga name cheese.
Fuck with me, baby!,
I'll make it milk til it drip down yo knees.
Spit that shit for real o, brain real o.
Kiddo says he looks up to me this just makes me feel old,
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero.
Man we were just in the food court eating guy gyros.
Yesterday that's the way,
Every single morning I try to pray!
Grandmama nem they never forgot, nothing else really means nothing to me.
I ain't stunting to be.
Talking to me?
Girl, why you fucking with me?
Move on, there
ain't nothing to see!
Shhh always something to song,
I'm the raw off the rip.
Cause of him all of them will remem the min that they fell in love with rap.
Black like having yo cousin back,
Blue like when that rent is due,
Cream like when I'm loving you!
Yeeaaah
So in love I'll give it all away,
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow!
Cause tonight is the night, oh, oh, oh
That I give you everything,
Music knocking until the morning light,
Cause we like to party!
Chorus:
We like to party, hey, hey, hey! hey! hey! hey!

You a bad girl and your friends bad too,
Oh, you got the swag sauce you drippin' swagu
I love you

You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation In connection to the sun
With you next to me There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrop I am the sea
With you and God,who's my sunlight I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud so proud to be your girl
You make the confusion Go all away
From this cold and messed up world
[Chorus]
I am in love with you
You set me free

Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you

And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am Baby you
Were my man
I know it ain't easy Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny I see myself having
Your child I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful To have you by my side
[Chorus]
Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world To love, to hold, To
Feel, To breathe, To love you
Dangerously in love
[Chorus]
Dangerously,
Dangerous,
Dangerously in love with you
Oh I love you I love you I love you I love
You...
Ooh baby

I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights
You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me let's me know you're mine
I'd rather be with you
Because I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because you hustle hard
To take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy I'd rather be with you (I'd rather be with you)
Boy I'd rather be with you
I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you boy don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies
Will all come true
I am your woman I belong to you, whoah
There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you oh
I'm holding back nothin' saving it all for you
Baby I love making love to you
It's like a high I can't come down from you
I'd rather be with you because I love the way
You scream my name (scream my name)
And there's no other man that gives me what I want

Part 1 - Ghost:
[Verse 1: Beyonce]
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind
can't help but wander: how come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm touring
All these people on the planet
Working 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive
All the people on the planet
Working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
How come?
What goes up, goes around
Goes around around around around
What goes up, goes around
Goes around around around around
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und
Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so..
Part 2 - Haunted:
[Verse: 2]
It's what you do
It's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
My heart it lulls
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
My wicked tongue
Where will it be
I know if I'm onto you
I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You want me? I walk down the hallway
You're lucky, the bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite,fuck me
[Verse: 3]
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me (onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me (onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me (onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me (onto you, I'm onto you)
[Outro]
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
[Verse 1: BeyoncÃ©]
These four lonely walls have changed the way I feel
The way I feel, I'm standing still
And nothing else matters now, you're not here
So where are you? I've been callin' you, I'm missin' you
[Pre-Chorus: BeyoncÃ©]
Where else can I go? Where else can I go?
Chasin' you, chasin' you
Memories turn to dust, please don't bury us
I got you, I got you
[Chorus: BeyoncÃ©]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
I'm ready to face it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
[Verse 2: Arrow Benjamin]
I've outrun the fears that chased, they're standin' still
I'm runnin' still, I'm runnin' still
And every voice that cried inside my head, forever drives
Forever drives, I kill the lights
[Pre-Chorus: Arrow Benjamin]
Where else can I go? Where else can I go?
Chasing you, chasing you
[Chorus: Arrow Benjamin + BeyoncÃ©]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
I'm ready to face it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
Verse 1-
I always loved you, even though did me wrong
I always stayed by your side, I guess I was your fool
I always cared, there's no one above you
I swear, cheated on me now she's there
Pre-Chorus-
She won't answer your calls, don't wanna be bothered at all
I guess I'll be the one standing with open arms
Sucka for love, kisses too
Ya touch, I'm crazy for you
Chorus-
I'll settle for you, yes I will be the one who will
Settle for you, yes I will be the one you run to
You come running to, yes I will be the one who will
Settle for you, settle for you
Verse 2-
I can never leave you, no matter how hard I try
You'll probably do it again, I'll still be right here waiting
Nothing has changed, it remains, the same, I can't explain
Pre-Chorus
Sucka for love, ya kisses too
Ya touch, I'm crazy for you
Chorus-1x
Bridge-
Even when the chips are down, I'll still settle for you
You'll probably hurt me again, I'll still settle for you
I know I must be the world's greatest fool
(repeat)
I'll still settle for you
Chorus- 1x
Ad-libs-
I will always love you no matter how hard I try
Probably do it again I'll still be here waiting
Stuck with you, in love with you, here for you, loving you
Settling for you baby yea
Si yo fuera un chico
Solo por una vez
Yo me vestiria como quiero
Con lo que vea primero y me voy
saldria a buscar, chicas por montÃ³n
Mis amigos que son leales
Siempre van acompaÃ±arme hasta el fin
Cada noche a mentir
Si yo fuera un chico
SÃ© que podrÃ­a saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
SabrÃ­a escuchar, pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasÃ³
Si yo fuera un chico
Pero ves no lo soy
Los chicos son de molde
Y nosotras somos de corazÃ³n
Se piensan que son
Los del sexo superior
Pero cuando lo queremos
Los vence nuestra seducciÃ³n, seducciÃ³n
Si yo fuera un chico
SÃ© que podrÃ­a saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
SabrÃ­a escuchar, pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasÃ³
Es muy tarde ya vez para regresar
Perdonarte otra vez, ya no lo vas a lograr
El lugar que ocupabas, tu ya no esta mÃ¡s
Pero eres un chico, que le vas a hacer
No puedes comprender
Que se siente al comprender mejor
Y amar en serio a una mujer
No sabes escuchar, no te importa el dolor
Hasta que pierdes a quien quieres
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasÃ³
Pero eres un chico, que le vas hacer
No puedes comprender
Que se siente al comprender mejor
Y amar en serio a una mujer
I like to feel so high and
you feel good feeling low
I like my colours vivid
and you paint your colours gold
I like to see the world and you like your weekends home
but I've been tagging behind while you refused to go
Chorus:
'Cause you're such a burden
but you're the weight off of my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
it still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign
You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes long
I like trips to the movies you watch TV all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And I've been right beside you losing me and doing the same
Chorus:
'Cause you're such a burden
but you're the weight off my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
it still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign
I looked around and baby you were gone
Where did I lost you honey
I even slowed down thought you'd follow
But you took your own roads honey
'Cause I've been travelling travelling travelling
only to find that I'm making this trip alone
And I've been staying behind while you refused to go
Chorus:
'Cause you're such a burden
but you're the weight off my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
it still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time
guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

Ran by the men but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equal
Still play my part and let you take the lead role
Believe me

I'll be the help whenever you need me
I see you hustle wit my hustle I
Can keep you
Focused on your focus I can feed you

(Uh HOV, Uh, HOV, uh huh huh!)
I B the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz sorta dude
It's big balling baby when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads and rooms at the Bloomberg
And rumors you on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger is like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me they watching
and we just yachting off the island hopping off
Amalfi coast
Mafioso, oh baby you ever seen Saturn
No, not the car but everywhere we are
You sure to see stars.
This is high level not eye level,
My bezzle courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow now look at the time I saved you
Mama let me upgrade you
[hook:]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
You my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star
Unless your flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me
Partner let me upgrade you

Every night I rush to my bed
with hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes
I'm goin outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
and I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin no where
Baby long as you're here
I'll be floatin on air cause you're my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy you my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up youre there
So wrap your arms around me for real
and tell me you'll stay by side
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
and I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin no where
Baby long as you're here
I'll be floatin on air cause you're my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Oh, You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still you live inside of me
So tell me how is that
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you babe
I don't wanna to play that part
I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way
No, no, I don't wanna a broken heart
And I don't wanna to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl
Something that I feel I need to say
But up 'til now I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving of me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes there are times when I hate you but I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you, I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you babe
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby
I don't wanna to play that part
I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way
No, no, I don't wanna a broken heart
And I don't wanna to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away, away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't wanna broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna to play that part
I know that I love you but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kinda way
No, no, I don't wanna a broken heart
I don't wanna to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl, broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl, no broken-hearted girl
Satellites flashing by
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
When nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side
In your eyes, love's alive
You've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites, satellites
Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display
Let's run and hide
In our eyes, love's alive
We've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites, satellites
If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart I cannot breathe
Satellites flashing by
Satellites
If I were a boy even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted
And go drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, to come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
And you don't understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you're taking her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
If I wrote a book about where we stand
The title of my book would be "Life with Superman"
That's how you make me feel
I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same
I see it everyday
And all the things you do
And all the things you say
You are my roc
Baby you're the truth
You are my roc
I love to rock with you
You are my roc
You're everything I need
You are my roc
So baby rock with me

I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my roc
I love to roc with you
I love to roc with you
Oh oh oh I
If I wanna try to count the ways
You make me smile
I'll run out of fingers
Before I run out of time
To sing to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my lovin strong
Make me wanna try my best
To give you what you want and what you need
Give you my whole heart, not just a little piece
More than a minimum, I'm talking everything
More than a single wish, I'm talking every dream
You are my roc
Baby you are the truth
You are my roc
I love to roc with you
You are my roc
You're everything I need
You are my roc
So baby roc with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right

There's options I dont want them
They're not worth my time
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you
I like us just fine
You're a roc in the sand
You're a smile in a cry
You're my joy through the pain
You're the truth through the lies
No matter what I do
I know that I can count on you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
You are my roc

Turn the lights on
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains, you're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
(Cover the skies)
And I hope it rains, you're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death can make us part
What kind of dream is this?
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
Your all alone
I did this
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know
I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make sometime for you but all i made you was lonely
Chorus
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
And caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
All of the times
You used to cry
Because i would let you down
I'm losin time
I should've tried
A little more to be around
But I didn't know that you were hurting, I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain: another you I'll never find
Chorus
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
And caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I'm filled with regret
I'm gonna tip and soak myself in misery
Now in your life
I'll take my time
No more yearning without me
But it hurts to think of you all by yourself but now I see
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me
Chorus
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
And caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there
You're all alone, and I did this
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you
And wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you
But all I made you was lonely
I couldn't see but now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known that I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
I should've been there, I should've been there
I should've been there, I should've been there
All of the times you used to cry
Because I would let you down
I'm losing time, I should've tried
A little more to be around
But I didn't know you that were hurting
I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain
Another you I'll never find
I couldn't see but now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known that I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
I should've been there (ooO0Oo), I should've been there (ooO0Oo)
I should've been there (ooO0Oo), I should've been there (ooO0Oo)
I'm filled with regret, I'm gonna tip
And sew/soak myself in misery
Now in your life I'll take more time
No more yearning without me
But it hurts to think of you
All by yourself and now I see
And I apologize for all the times
I left you home waiting for me
I couldn't see but now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known that I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed, Forever to bleed
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there
Everything'll be alright again
Alright again, alright again
The heart is stronger than you think
Like it could go through anything
And even when you think it cant
It finds a way to still push on though
Sometimes you wanna run away
Ain't got the patience for the pain
And if you don't believe it look into your heart
The beat goes on
I'm tellin' you things get better through whatever
If you fall, dust it off, don't let up
Don't you know you can go be your own miracle
You need to know!
If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you'don't give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Don't give up, through it all, just stand up
Ooh, its like we all had better days
Problems getting all up in your face
Just because you go through it
Don't mean it gotta take control, no
You ain't gotta find no hiding place
Because the heart can beat the hate
Don't wanna let the mind keep playing you
Saying you cant go on
Im' tellin' you things get better through whatever
If you fall, dust if off, don't let up
Don't you know you can go be your own miracle
You need to know!
If the mind keeps thinking youve had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'dont give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Dont give up, through it all, just stand up
Through it all, just stand up
You dont gotta be a prisoner in your mind
If you fall, dust it off, you can live your life
Yeah, let your heart be your guide
Yeah yeah yeah
You will know there's a good if you trust the good
Everything will be alright, yeah
Light up the dark, if you follow your heart
And it will get better through whatever
If the mind keeps thinking youve had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'dont give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Dont give up, through it all, just stand up
If the mind keeps thinking youve had enough
But the heart keeps telling you 'dont give up'
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?
Dont give up, through it all, just stand up
You got it in you, find it within
You got in now, find it within now
You got in you, find it within
You got in now, find it within now
You got in you, find it within
You got in now, find it within now
Find it within you, find it within
Through it all, just stand up

Oh I know that you treat me right
but still I think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm on to the next
and I think you're nice, but I saw something else that I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm on to the next Oh
[Verse 1]
Today when I wake up
You didn't look the same as last night
And it just don't feel right anymore
I think that we should break up
There's no reason to make up
I won't fight, I'm just tired and I need a change
[bridge1]
Sorry boy but you got me bored and something's catching my eye
I was only satisfied for a little while (I gotta switch him out switch him out switch him out switch him out) Kick him out kick him out kick him out kick him out
[hook]
Oh I know that you treat me right
but still I think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm on to the next
and I think you're nice, but I saw something else that I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm on to the next Oh
[Verse 2]
You call me to frequently
I thought it was so sweet
In the beginning
But now you're too clingy for me
You don't put the seat down
You don't clean the house how
I like it (trifling)
That's reason enough, your time's expired
[bridge2]
Sorry boy but you got me bored I gotta move around
If I ain't gotta ring by now that means I'm not tied down (I gotta switch him out switch him out switch him out switch him out) Kick him out kick him out kick him out kick him out
[hook]
Oh I know that you treat me right
but still I think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm on to the next
and I think you're nice, but I saw something else that I like
And I think I gotta make you my next ex
I'm on to the next Oh

Remember those walls I built
Well Baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo (oh oh)
I've got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
'Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
The risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Head down as I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
eyes shut, I find myself in love racing the earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
I wanna run, run, smash into you
I wanna run, run, smash into you
Ears closed, what I hear no one else has to know
'Cause I know in that what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
I wanna run, run, smash into you
I wanna run, run, smash into you, smash into you
Head down, as I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
I should, I'm in love and I'm racing the earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
Oh, I wanna run, smash into you
I'm willing to run, smash into you
I'm willing to run and run, and run, and run, ooh
I'm ready to run and run, and run, and run, ooh
And I wanna run, run, smash into you
I'm willing to run, run, smash into you
{verse 1}
If I were a boy even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they stick up for me
{Chorus}
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taking you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
{Verse}
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home...
{Chorus}
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (wanted)
'Cause he's taking you for granted (granted)
And everything you had got destroyed
{Bridge}
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
{Chorus }
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah you don't understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you're taking her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy!
All the single ladies, (all the single ladies)

All the single ladies, (all the single ladies)
All the single ladies Now put your hands up
Up in the club (club), we just broke up (up), I'm doing my own little thing.
Decided to dip (dip) and now you wanna trip (trip)
'Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Just cried my tears, for three good years
You can't get mad at me
'Cause if you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
'Cause if you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh x2
If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it, then you t be mad once you see that he want it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Got me tighter in my carry-on jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I can't care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn, and now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me
'Cause if you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
'Cause if you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't treat me to these things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Is a man that makes me then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost I'll be gone
All the single ladies,( all the single ladies)

Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it, oh oh oh
You're all alone
And I did this
I've got
No one else to blame
You didn't know
I was a risk
And it's such
A crying shame
How you gave me
All of you
And wanted
Nothing else from me
But to make
Some time for you
But all I made you
Was lonely
I couldn't see
But I know
That I acted
Selfishly
I shoulda known
That I let you down
Caused you
So much misery
Forever to bleed (5x)
I shoulda been there (4x)
All of the times
You used to cry
Because
I would let you down
I'm losing time
I shoulda tried
A little more
To be around
But I didn't know
That you were hurting
I was just to blind
Only thing
I know for certain
Another you
I'll never find
I couldn't see
But I know
That I acted selfishly
I shoulda known
That I let you down
Caused you
So much misery
Forever to bleed (5x)
I shoulda been there (4x)
I'm through
With regret
I'm gonna tip
And soak myself
In misery
Now in yo life
I'll take more time
No more yearning
Without me
But it hurts
To think of you
All by yo self
But now I see
And I apologize
Ffor all the times
I left you home
Waiting for me
I couldn't see
But I know
That I acted
Selfishly
I shoulda known
That I let you down
Caused you
So much misery
Forever to bleed (4x)
(2x)
I'm gonna be there
(I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there
(I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there
(I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there
Uh, oh, uh, oh
Uh, oh, uh
Ohhhhhhhh
Hey honey
Cat got your tongue
Don't look so funny
Mister comedian
Joke's on you
And you're good at bets
So where's my money
I know you bet
I'd never make that move
So why's the house empty?
Light's off by the end of this week
I'll leave with what I came with baby
I'll take the dogs, you keep the mercedes
Cause I'm gone, I'm not fazed
I walk these roads with grace
And I'll wave with you behind me
With a new smile on my face
Cause I'm walking in new shoes now
I got a new song to sing
When I walk in the room every head turns
Every eye is on me
To bad you're not here to see it
And by the time you get this
I'll be so long gone and far
I'll send you a postcard
Aha I'll send you a postcard
Hey baby
You seen a ghost? this ain't yo lady
This is the chick that you held back now
All of the things you've said were crazy
I checked out my list and I feel good about it
I got the new haircut
The one that you said wouldn't look no good
Took that job you said I could not get
Wore that dress you said I'd never fit in
I think that we should break up
Theres no reason to make up
I wont fight, Im just tired and I need a change
Sorry boy, but you got me bugging, somethings catching my eye
I was only satisfied for a little while
I gotta twitch him out, twitch him out, twitch him out, twitch him out
Kick him out, kick him out, kick him out, kick him out
If I beg and if I cry would it change the sky tonight?
Will it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call? Is there any hope at all?
Are you drifting by?
When I think about it I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
And then I lie all by myself, I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed, if it's good, it's got to last
It feels so right
When I think about it I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
I missed all the signs one at a time
You were ready
What did I know starting our lives
No, my love I'm ready to show
When I think about it I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it the less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here and then
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, you disappear, disappear
Do you think you could fall for a woman like me?
Cause I find it hard to trust, I need to much, and I really don't believe in Love (No No)
Do You think that I could be the girl of your dreams?
Sometimes I don't let things go, get emotional, and sometimes i'm just outta control.
You need to stop for a minute.
Before you get to deep up in it (Too Deep)
Everything ain't what it seems.
It's hard lovin a woman, a woman like me.
You need to think about it.
Before you get hooked on a venom and can't live without it (No No NO).
Can't believe everything you see.
It's hard lovin a woman, a woman like me.
Do you think that I could be the one that you see?
Cause baby i'm one step ahead
Your two steps behind, but baby I don't mind
Do you think that I could make you real happy, baby?
Just don't get me wrong
My lovin is so strong, but I ain't trying to lead you on
You need to stop for a minute.
Before you get to deep up in it (No NO)
Everything ain't what it seems. (Seems)
It's hard lovin a woman, a woman like me. (Woman Like Me)
You need to think about it.
Before you get hooked on a venom and can't live without it (Without it)
Can't believe everything you see.
It's hard lovin a woman, a woman like me. (Meeeeeeeeeee)
Woman Like Meeeeee
A Woman Like Meeeee
Woman Like Meeeeeeeeeeee, OH!
You need to stop for a minute. (Stop for a Minute)
Before you get to deep up in it (Before you get so deep up in it)
Everything ain't what it seems.
It's hard lovin a woman, a woman like me.
You need to think about it. (Think about it baby)
Before you get hooked on a venom and can't live without it (No No).
Can't believe everything you see.
It's hard lovin a woman, a woman like me.
A Woman Like Me, Woman Like Me,
Woman Like Me
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes--I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I've moved on
Because I realized I've got
[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I--that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry; I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' my own best friend
Me, myself, and I--that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry; I took a vow that from now
I'm gon' my own best friend
You're so controlling; you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over stop calling me; come pick up yo' clothes
Ain't no need to front like ya still with me--all your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got
[Chorus]
(I got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(Now I'm about to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(I got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(Now I'm about to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(I got me, myself, and I)
Me, myself, and I
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I have cried so many times
(I can't regret time spent with you)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Now I'm about to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(I got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(Now I'm about to make it through)
I could see the sun shine if I be myself tonight
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a dream to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Oh yeah, you smile, you smile
Oh, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last

If you ain't getting money then you ain't got nothing for me
Tell me somethin' where your boss at?
Where my ladies up in there that like to talk back
I wanna see ya, I'd like to meet cha

Na, na, na, diva is a female version of a huslter
Of a hustler, of a, of a huslter
Na, na, na, diva is a female version of a huslter
Of a a hustler, of a, of a huslter
Since fifteen in my stilettos been struttin' in this game
What's your age? Was the question they asked when I hit the stage
I'm a diva, best believe her, you see her, she getting paid
She ain't callin' him to greet her, don't need him, her bed's made
This is a stick up, stick up
I need them bags, uh, that money
A stick up, stick up
You see them ask, where that money?

I'm a, I'm a, a diva, I'm a, I'm a, a diva, hey
Oh baby, how you doing?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase
Some women were made but me, myself
I like to think that I was created for a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you? You feel me
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a sight to see, kind of something like me
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he love my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano
She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
Never thought the grace of God, go High
I found heaven on earth
You were my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down
You are my heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
saying Ave Maria
Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hits you and then you realize
It's out of your hands, baby you got to understand
You are my heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria, Ave Maria, Ave Maria
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I'm feelin' sexy, I wanna hear you say my name, boy
If you can reach me, you can feel my burning flame
Feelin' kind of N A S T Y
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe is just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy, babe
Babe, I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
You're so sexy, tonight I am all yours, boy
The way your body moves across the floor
Feelin' kind of N A S T Y
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe is just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy, babe
Babe, I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
I'm in this fight and I'm swinging and my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand and I can't barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along a wall
And I'm scared of the only heart beat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone, I can't seem to breathe
When I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely, I'm scared of lonely
I cry at night 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you I'll stretch your hand looking for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along a wall
And I'm scared of the only heart beat I hear beating is my own
I'm scared of being alone, I can't seem to breathe
When I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness
I think I'm drowning, I can't be lonely no more
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along a wall
And I'm scared of the only heart beat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone, I can't seem to breathe
When I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of be the only shadow I see along a wall
And I'm scared of the only heart beat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone, I can't seem to breathe
When I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely, I'm scared of lonely
Beyonce: Halo
Remember those walls I built
Well baby they tumbling down
And they didnt even put up a fight
They didnt even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
Bridge:
Its like Ive been awakened

To be free no,no.

Sitting here
Thinking
Of your kiss
And your
Warm embrace

A reflection
In the glass

To my lips now

That are
On my face
And baby, baby

Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up, I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to dip and now you wanna trip
'Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Just cried my tears, for three good years
Ya can't be mad at me
'Cause if you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
'Cause if you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Got me tighter in my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I can care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn, and now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me
'Cause if you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
'Cause if you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't treat me to the things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here's a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms, say I'm the one you own
If you don't, you'll be alone, and like a ghost, I'll be gone

If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Oh, oh, oh
If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Oh, oh, oh
Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they are tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But, I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had, you break it
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out!
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace

To pull me back to the ground again

Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
Till your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that's why you're beautiful
I'm not wondering why the sky's blue
That's not my business
All I know is I look up and tell myself
Be patient, love that could be us
Lovers used to make love
And die just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love, wasn't it beautiful?
Don't ask me why the sky's blue
That's not my business
All I know is I look up and tell myself
Be patient, love that could be us
Diamonds used to be coal
Look young cause they got soul
And my heart used to be cold
Till your hands laid on my soul
Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be us, that's why we're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
Ooh, why? Why?
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
I love you
I love you
I love you
Baby I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation In connection to the sun
With you next to me There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrop I am the sea
With you and God,who's my sunlight I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud so proud to be your girl
You make the confusion Go all away
From this cold and messed up world
[Chorus]
I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me
And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am Baby you
Were my man
I know it ain't easy Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny I see myself having
Your child I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful To have you by my side
[Chorus]
Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world To love, to hold, To
Feel, To breathe, To love you
Dangerously in love
[Chorus]
Dangerously,
Dangerous,
Dangerously in love with you
Oh I love you I love you I love you I love
You...

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]
Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins
Mama, so put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Girl you so fine, put your love on top
If you're going through it just know it's called "going through it"
You're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die
You're gonna survive
[Intro: BeyoncÃ©]
Dum-da-de-da
Do, do, do, do, do, do

Scoring touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever like Bun B
And I'm Rambo-ing these hoes
I'm really rit like Donjae
I'm camo-ing these hoes
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy, you know I look good as fuck
Wish I was your baby momma
Want me to come around and give you good karma, but no
We escalating, up in this bitch like elevators
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Of course sometimes shit go down
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator
Ha-ha! God damn, God damn, God damn
[Bridge 1: BeyoncÃ©]
Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister taught me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)
[Hook: BeyoncÃ©]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless

Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn
[Bridge 2: BeyoncÃ©]
I wake up looking this good
And I wouldn't change it if I could
(If I could, if I, if I, could)
And you can say what you want, I'm the shit
(What you want I'm the shit, I'm the shit)
(I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit)
I want everyone to feel like this tonight
